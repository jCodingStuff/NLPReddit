      "        \"selftext\": \"I'm 25 and recently engaged, my sister is 29 and has been married for 3 years. She and her husband have been trying to have a baby forever, longer than they've been married, and it's just not happening even after several rounds of IVF. They've dumped a ton of money into trying to have a baby and are starting to look at other options. Unfortunately, they think I'm one of those options.\\n\\nMy sister asked if I would be a surrogate for her and I absolutely do not want to. I'm not planning to have any kids of my own so I'm not exactly interested in being pregnant. I know it would be an amazing gift for her, but it seems like it would be a nine month nightmare for me. My fiance has also expressed that he is not comfortable with it. Also for as much as I don't want to be pregnant in general, I ten-times don't want to be pregnant or recently post-partum at my wedding, especially with a baby that isn't even mine.\\n\\nI love my sister, but to be honest the whole thing seems downright creepy (for me. if other women want to be surrogates for their siblings I don't think there's anything wrong with that.)\\n\\nHere's the sticky part. My sister was my caregiver for a little over a year after I developed severe mental health issues when I was 18-19. I had very strong agoraphobia and did not leave our apartment once during that time, and I was clinically depressed. My sister did all of my food shopping and meal prep, talked me off the ledge several times, and was basically my emotional crutch. After years of intense therapy I am now at a point where I am functional, happy most days, and in a healthy relationship. I regret the way I treated my sister during this time and that I made her my caregiver. And there's a little voice in the back of my telling me that if I give her a baby then I will make up for it. And she has implied the same in our few conversations about the matter. But I just really, really don't want to be pregnant.\",\n",

She recently downloaded tindr and had me help pick out the pictures for her profile. Fine so far. About a week into her experience with the app she started telling me -in vivid detail- of her encounters with various men and women. At first I just listened and tried to change the subject as soon as possible, but then she got a boyfriend and starting reporting on an almost daily basis of what they did, the sex toys they were buying, and how they were implementing them. At this point I got pretty fed up and told her that I thought what she was telling me was a serious breech of trust between her and her partner, that I didn\\u2019t want to hear it, and there are some things that she should just keep to herself. She was hurt and offended, and told me that she thought she could be open with me about anything. I repeated that there are just some things you shouldn\\u2019t share with others and there are things I wouldn\\u2019t share with her, or anyone else for that matter. She became very pissed off at me when I said this and it has spiraled into a huge argument of whether oversharing is really \\u201ca thing.\\u201d I\\u2019m not dumb, I know I\\u2019m right in my position that oversharing most certainly exists, no matter how comfortable you are talking about the topic. However, she is right in that we are (were?) very close, and I\\u2019m starting to feel like I\\u2019m the asshole for not just shutting up and being supportive. I also said some dumb stuff that probably came across as accusatory but was not directed at her and was in the context of a more general situation like talking to a stranger. (\\u201coversharers lack boundaries, come across as desperate, are naive, and it\\u2019s just generally not a good a idea, etc.\\u201d). Recently, she brought this arguement into our whole friend group, and literally everyone agrees with her that I\\u2019m being an ass, and people should be able to be open about whatever they want.

      "        \"selftext\": \"A bit of context. At the end of 2013 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. I've been dealing with it since then (really i was dealing with it before then, but i didn't have a name for it at that point) and it's been getting continuously worse over time. In spite of my depression, I got engaged, made some great friends, and got a job I enjoy. Even with all that going well for me, I go through periods of time that I just can't function properly. There are times that i miss work because I'm too tired to do my job, and I feel that I'm not giving my fianc\\u00e9e the love and attention that she deserves, despite the fact that I'm giving all of it to her. Most days, I just genuinely feel like I'm not good enough for the people and things that surround me, and I'm not sure if it's just me overthinking things, or if I'm a genuinely bad person. I've had friends who stopped talking to me because I stopped being the energetic guy they liked to hang out with, and i feel guilty about it. Even though i feel like I'm doing everything I can in the moment, i see that i haven't been giving my all because of my situation. Since I know I should be doing more,I feel guilty that i can't find the motivation or energy to do so. I've started ignoring people that tell me to \\\"Get out of bed and do something\\\" or anything along those lines. I've started to wall myself off from the rest of the world, because I feel like they've started judging me. The worst part about it is that I'm worried that I'm hurting my fianc\\u00e9e with my behavior. I try to keep up with her, but I'm worried that i lack the motivation she fell in love with. I'm worried she might be suffering in silence, and I don't know how to fix it. Am I am asshole?\\n\\nTLDR-I have started to ignore people because I'm not sure of how i can deal with my depression, and even though I'm doing the best I can, I'm worried that I'm hurting my loved ones. \\n\\nI'm exhausted right now, so i apologize if there are any grammatical errors. If there are any, I'll fix them shortly. \\n\\nEdit. So it turns out that one of my worries had been well founded. After talking to my fianc\\u00e9e about my situation, she got upset that it took me so long to realize I was hurting her, and she left me. I know that you all have left me kind words and helped me realize that i may have been over thinking some of it, but i might need your guidance once more. \",\n",

I hadn't heard from him all night, he claimed his phone died, whatever...I wanted to touch base so he wouldn't drive home drunk (which he has a fairly consistent history of doing). I got in touch with him the next morning, claims he didn't drive at all but was hungover. I asked if he was just going to be miserable in bed all day; I didn't just want to be in bed all day while he was nursing a hangover. He said no, and that he intended to start drinking when he and his roommate got back from the store (it was 9am). I thought he was kidding...\\n\\nI arrive, with multiple items after several stops he requested so we could make something for dinner. He was already into the vodka and fireball. I work nights, and didn't have to be at work until 9pm the next night, I thought, what the hell, and had a couple shots myself and some wine. An hour or so goes by and he goes to his bedroom to lay down. He puts on some videos (cops or whatever) and I suggest a movie since he was passing out anyway.\\n\\nOne of my favorites was playing, The Big Lebowski. Bf was chatty, in and out, a little flirty, but was likely a little tipsy, as was I. I was chatting to him about the movie. He asked me to go get him cake. I brought it back, continued to give him movie trivia, and his tone and demeanor quickly changed. Angrily \\\"I'm just trying to take a nap, sorry I don't care about your shitty movie!\\\" I was floored. I forgot exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of berating him for talking to me like garbage (a conversation we also had the night before). I was mad and flustered and started to collect my things to leave.\\n\\nOn my way home, I realized I had forgotton the license plates he was going to put on my car that day. I was pretty pissed at myself, but had to turn around to get them. He confronted me in the living room, was apologetic, asked me to lie down with him...I was already too creeped out and in tears, railing off about how disrespectful he was.\\n\\n Him: \\\"All I want to do is lie down\\\"\\nMe: \\\"then I'm fucking leaving, why did you have me come over to begin with?\\\"\\n\\nI stormed out and collected more of my things. The next day I cleaned my stuff completely out of his place and left his key on the table, not trying to be passive aggressive, but transparent. I haven't heard from him since, I don't intend to see him again.\\n\\nEDIT: grammar, details\\n\\nTl;dr, boyfriend of a few months with possible drinking problem, talks to me like crap. I intend to ghost him after clearing house of my things. \",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"Throwaway because people at work are reddit fiends. \\n\\nPrologue:\\nI live at the corner unit of a town home building that has pretty thin walls. Thin enough to sometimes hear a neighbor snoring when he is sleeping in another room, which is not the master bedroom. I soundproofed the whole downstairs, just did not get to the 2nd floor yet. This is how the layout works in our building so atleast the master bedrooms don't share the same wall. Recently got a new neighbor. Guy that is around my age: late 20s or early 30s. Super nice guy that says hello and smiles everyday. He is a pretty good neighbor only had 2 parties in the 3 months he has lived here and he is pretty respectful about ending the party around midnight. \\n\\nLet's jump in. \\n\\nSaturday 11:30pm.\\nMe and my wife are getting back after a night out. Pulling into our street we see around 5-7 German cars parked all around the street. We know already based on the past our boy is having a party. Cool. We love it, as we like to host many parties in the summer ourselves and are pretty cool with a younger neighbor that will not mind us when we turn up the music, ect. \\n\\nLike always the party ended around 12:15. Respect. I can tell the guests were pretty hammered due to constantly falling on the walls, shutting the door loud as fuck, ect. That's cool. I get it. We stay up till around 2am watching Netflix. I fall asleep. \\n\\n4AM:\\n\\\"Wake up, I think I'm going to call the cops.\\\" My wife wakes me up with this phrase all of a sudden and I right away think somebody is trying to break in. Not a cool line to wake somebody up with IMO. My wife explains to me the neighbor has been yelling at his wife and cursing her out in Russian for the last hour while I was sleeping. (My wife is not Russian but can understand a lot of it, enough to make out he was saying \\\"this is all your fault you suka\\\" , which is bitch is English. She also heard super loud thuds/noises throughout the whole upstairs. (Not sure if stuff is being throw, but what we assumed is aggressive fighting going at it from room to room. My wife described it that it sounded like he dragged her from room to room, she kept on trying to run away. \\n\\nI start hearing the thuds as well as the yelling and crying. My wife told me she is getting anxiety just listening to this and Def can't sleep at all. \\n\\nWe call the police to do a check up right away. (If nothing dangerous is occurring, it's a simple check up. 3 minutes in we hear the police come by and everything gets quiet. \\n\\nThen it hits me about 2 weeks ago I specifically placed my Arlo WiFi camera to face my street because a neighbor kept leaving annoying notes on my car about our association's parking which is another story. Right away I turn on live mode. Bam: we got front row seats to this. Grab the popcorn. We see 2 squad cars right in front. It looks like they are just the back up as the cops parked across from each other so they can chat with the windows down. There are more cars due to the lighting in the street and I'm pretty sure there is an ambulance as well because the street is lit up way too well (scene lights, there is always an ambulance dispatched to a domestic violence call) but we can't see anything due to the camera cutting off the view. \\n\\nA few seconds in we see the girl with her girlfriend and a suitcase leaving the driveway and getting out of the cameras view. Everything gets quiet. \\n\\nWhat I thought initially was that maybe he just got too drunk and they will take him in overnight until he sobers up, which is pretty common in domestic calls like that. \\n\\nThe thing is. My neighbor never came back. His car has not moved since Saturday night and is all frozen snowed in. Not a peep from the unit. It's Wed now. \\n\\nSo not sure what really happened could be a couple things. \\n\\n1. He is a  Eastern European dude with a pretty strong accent so we were thinking he might not even have papers. It's a far stretch, but it's pretty common for where we live in the U. S. Among the European population. We are Europeans ourselves. \\n\\n2. Perhaps police found some drugs after the party. I assume if you're hammered you'd go to sleep right away and not stay up 4 hours after the party and eventually go nuts on your gf. \\n\\n3. Or just abuse happened, the cops either saw marks on the GF or she said that yes she was abused, or both. \\n\\nObviously I don't think I am a complete asshole for calling the cops but there is no way I would stand for domestic abuse at that level and hey if nothing was wrong the gf would deny all accusations and I'm sure the only thing that would happen is he would be locked away for a night to sober up and it would have been just documented. \\n\\nWe are just wondering honestly what happened and I thought I'd share it with the internet. He only has 2 neighbors and obviously one of us called. I don't really care if he finds out that it's me. I will update if I find out anything new. \\n\\nEdit: definetly did not make this post to discuss politics and immigration so leave those opinions out. \\n\\nEdit: for those wondering why I assumed deportation is because it's pretty common for Europeans/many others around the Midwest not to have papers, or just have temporary status. For some reason it's one of the things that popped up in my mind at first. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

(His parents have talked about having him tested, but they never did because his dad was too scared of it coming out positive.)\\nAlthough he gets picked on, he doesn.t let it affect him easily. He tells me about how he never really was well liked in schools before, and I wasn.t either. But he, unlike myself, is mostly a happy and energetic kid.\\n\\nWell, except when he.s asked to do something..\\n\\nYou see, me and my friends sit mostly on the same tables. Even most the teachers know where we sit, so do the lunchtime staff. We usually leave quite a mess and recently we.ve been getting warnings from staff about cleaning up after ourselves. I am usually the one who tries to get people to clean up, to save us from detentions, but Al almost always makes quite a lot of mess and never really cleans it up.\\nAl is very VERY stubborn, he always has been. Asking him nicely, shouting at him, doesn.t matter. He won.t do anything anyone says.\\nEven when I kindly ask him not to hug me every 5 minutes (he.s a clingy person), or ask him not to stand too close to me, or not to throw things, he keeps at it!\\n\\nI get irritated easily, quite easily, very easily. You can see how this would get on my nerves at times. I oftentimes call him out on this behaviour and \\u201cthrow shade\\u201d at him for being stubborn. I wasn.t always like this, but over the last few school years, I became more distant and angry. Not even I.m sure why. Him bringing unwanted attention by being stubborn and, truthfully, lazy is extremely annoying. He always get quite upset when he.s scolded and apologises a lot, but almost always persists afterwards.\\n\\nWe talk about this often, we agree that it could be school.s fault (because most people there are very judgmental and I get very on edge at school), but I.m never sure. Maybe it is him and he.s the reason I.m so constantly on edge, maybe I should loosen up, I don.t know.\\n\\nI.d also like to note, other friends also call him out sometimes, call him annoying, but never as much as me. \\nAlso, this isn.t just about the tables, but that was a recent example.\\n\\nI really don.t know who the true ass here is, so I await judgement with hope in finding answers and/or compromise.\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"When I (18F) was 17, I worked as a cashier at a grocery store while I went to college. A bagger who was an older male (in his 60s?) liked to make comments about the young girls who worked there being \\\"beautiful\\\", called us all \\\"sweetheart\\\" and was constantly hugging us and kissing us on the cheek. On my 18th birthday (I got a new nametag to reflect that I wasn't a minor) he said to me \\\"What a shame. You're no longer forbidden fruit\\\". He also made comments about me giving him a massage sometime because I was in school for it.\\n\\n I've since graduated, gotten with my now boyfriend (27M) and gotten a job as a massage therapist at a rehab facility. I stopped by the grocery store today with my boyfriend today to see about getting my tax documents, and I ran into the old coworker (let's call him John). I was in my new work uniform with the company logo on it. I saw John walking towards me and whispered to my boyfriend that he was a pervert and that he had referred to me as forbidden fruit when I worked there.\\n\\nJohn comes up and proceeds to hug me and give me a disgusting kiss on the cheek and asks how I am. I step back and make small talk hoping he'd go away, when he mentions that I should give him my card and work on him. I say I don't have any made yet (lie) and when he asked where Iworked, I tell him I work at a different clinic than I do, and that I'll likely be moved a bit north later on (lie).\\n\\nJohn looks at my boyfriend and asks for clarification, and my boyfriend told tbe directions to the ACTUAL clinic I worked at.\\n\\nJohn gave me a look (I think he knew I lied) and then soon left. I asked my boyfriend why he'd tell him that, and my boyfriend said that I worked in a safe clinic and that I should make money when I can if I'm safe. I told him that that wasnt the point, and that I shouldn't invite people like him at my work place. We walk through the store for a moment, and then I stop and say that I can't believe he'd tell John where I worked. Boyfriend is aggravated that I won't drop it, and soon goes to wait in the car.\\n\\n\\nWhen I get in the car, my boyfriend says that 1. I shouldn't mumble cues to him if I have something to say, and 2. If I didn't want to talk to John, I should have walked away instead of blaming it on him for telling John my work place location.\\n\\nI'm upset because I'm nervous John will come by my clinic now and be inclined to make advances at me, and I'm upset that my boyfriend didn't stand up for me or at the very least not call me out on a self defensive lie. However, my boyfriend feels I'm overreacting and that if I was really that worried I shouldn't have allowed John to engage me in the first place.\\n\\nAITA?\",\n",

My brother was annoyed and decided instead to grab the scruff of her neck rather tightly for several minutes. She looked really uncomfortable and I said as calmly as I could \\\"(Brother), let her go. She's fine.\\\" I had to say it a few times for him to stop.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'm also concerned about the way he's treating one of our cats, Marcel. Marcel had an incident where he was scared by a contractor who entered through the basement storm doors, which is where his litter boxes are. This combined with pain from defecation (his stool was often bloody before we switched him to a higher protein food) has caused him not to defecate in the litter box. Instead, he goes on the cement floor in the basement. We've tried to get him to stop and eventually realized that he probably won't and if we try anymore he might choose to shit upstairs, which is worse. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy brother is mad that Marcel does this, and has said stuff \\\"If we kick him he'll probably stop,\\\" and \\\"he knows what he's doing is bad, we should punish him.\\\" Punishing the cat is a terrible idea, and might make him decide to start going to the bathroom in a worse place.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy cat took a dump on the basement floor and my brother caught him a moment afterwards, then chased him upstairs and when my cat jumped on the couch, my brother blew in his face several times. My cat was obviously upset about this and his eyes got all big and he flinched. Me and both of my parents told him to stop. I'm upset about it. A few minutes ago, my brother came to talk to me and said if he caught Marcel he would be able to stop him. I don't know how he intends to accomplish this but it's really worrying me. I got a bit upset and told my brother not to try anything, he's an old cat and he's fine. My brother got annoyed and left.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAm I the asshole for getting upset? Is it unreasonable to be upset about this type of thing? I'm worried my brother's behavior will get worse or he'll hurt my cat seriously. My cat is 14 and pretty healthy but I'm still really worried. I don't think he'll hurt my dog but the attitude towards Marcel is upsetting. \",\n",

This is hard enough, I would rather just end the pregnancy and try again once we're up to it. I feel like a failure, and I just want to get past this and have it be over so we can try again at our family. But my husband wants to meet him. He thinks it would bring us more \\\"closure\\\" when he dies. I think its just going to open me up to more pain. Pregnancy is hard enough without the life at the end of the tunnel. I understand my husband is having just as hard of a time as me right now, and it might bring him closure to say his goodbyes to the little guy. And maybe I am being insensitive or selfish? I just dont want to have to grieve a second time over him...am I being selfish? The longer we wait the harder it gets and I just want to tell him too bad, and end the pregnancy, but I dont want to hurt him or our marriage and he just wont listen...\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for everyones kind words. We are still talking it through, but many points were brought to light that we hadnt even thought of in our grief, so we are getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate everyone who reached out to me and shared their own personal experiences.\\n\\nTo the people who are telling me to \\\"put my faith in God\\\" and \\\"I need to have hope, maybe he will survive\\\". Honestly, please look up any Patau syndrome cases before you urge someone to have false hope. We're inbetween saying goodbye in person later after his death or saying goodbye and letting him go now. Obviously our situation isnt looking good or we wouldnt be considering it in the first place\",\n",

Sorry if it took too long and if it sounds like a rant/Seek of validation\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is, I'm in high school now and this happened two years ago but every once in a while it pops into my mind so I might as well share. Just to be clear I use the term hate loosely, at the time I just really disliked her and now I just wouldn't be willing to call her friend.\\n\\nTwo years ago I was in this friend group. I'll call the main girl this is about Gale. Gale and one of my other friends have both dated this one guy before all this happened, my friend had just gotten back together with him but was too scared to tell Gale cause she thought she'd get mad. She told the other 4 people in our small friend group, one of which was me, beforehand. One of us accidentally mentioned it to Gale and she got really mad. She had a big fight with my other friend and my best friend and she blocked me without ever talking to me. Her reasoning for this was because we knew and didn't tell her. This annoyed me because Gale is kind of a huge gossip and she had a habit for telling everyone in our group whatever secret she just heard except me, choosing to dangle it over my head until she got tired of my begging(there was no reason for this since I never share people's secrets anyways). Anyway, my best friend argued that she didn't tell her because it wasn't her secret to tell and I felt the same way. Gale ended up becoming good friends again with my best friend but never talked to me about anything relating to that drama. I later found out she was actually mad because she liked our friend and was jealous of their ex which struck me as childish and made me dislike her more. We've only had one full conversation afterwards that ended in a big fight that was completely my fault. Now we just pretend we never knew each other and say about a sentence to each other every month.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At the start of high school (just became a freshman), my friends and I broke two friendships with (a) and (b). I was told that they\\u2019ve been having problems with our friendship since the start of summer (end of grade 8).\\n\\n  \\nDuring summer, when (a) texted about her vacation, only one person texted saying bye instead of people usually bombarding with \\u201cI\\u2019ll miss you\\u201d in our chat. She got extremely upset and ask us if we hated her. When people saw her text, they obviously comforted her but she still felt that we didn't like her.  \\nNext, our friend group wouldn\\u2019t hang out and we would just chat around. When she asked to hang out, my friend and I agreed but then we found out she was hanging out with someone who isn't in our friend group. We brushed it off and just hung out with just us two. Weirdly, after a couple of days, (a) said that we didn't want to hang out with her and that we hated her. She had ranted about us not liking her and everyone gave her supporting messages once again. Was it our faults that we didn\\u2019t hang out with her sooner?\\n\\n  \\nWhen high school started, (b) started to have problems too. Another friend and I often joked about the \\u201c#white girl\\u201d meme and how the Whites and Asians in our group would be separated in our group (which is true). (b) didn't like that and pretty much said I was being racist (she said that when we ended our friendship.) Also, as an \\u201cedgy teen\\u201d, I would joke about suicide, like how after doing something embarrassing, I would say that \\u201c I want to jump off the roof\\u201d and \\u201ccan I just die already\\u201d. Both (a) and (b) didn't like that. (b) said that it wasn\\u2019t funny because they had depression and that I should\\u2019ve known not to joke about the \\u201c#white girl\\u201d meme, the segregation in our groups + the depression jokes because she was depressed. I was shocked by that statement. I didn\\u2019t know she would\\u2019ve been that affected because I had friends who had depression but liked to joke about it all the time. I should\\u2019ve known.\\n\\n  \\nThere were also times where our group would be separated from (a) and (b) during lunch. One time, we were all in Pizza Pizza and decided to stay there, (a) and (b) were outside. We later ask them if they wanted to join us, but they refused. They said that was when they felt the most left out.\\n\\n  \\nBecause of all those problems, (a) and (b) decided to leave the chat without telling us. When we tried to talk to them about it, (a) asked us why we looked like we were going to kill her. Honestly, I don\\u2019t know what to think of this. I know that it\\u2019s been months and I\\u2019ve apologized to them both (they both said it was okay), but when I approached one of (b)\\u2019s friends to ask a question recently (she was there and happy), she immediately stops smiling and putted on her RBF. It looked like she was really affected by what we said and did and I can\\u2019t help but think of it. Am I the asshole for not asking (a) to hang out or saying that I\\u2019ll miss her?  (she's an emotional person) And should I have already known not to say those maybe mean jokes to (b)?  \\nBtw, i knew they had depression and I feel like shit typing that now.  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\\u2019s insistent that there\\u2019s a double standard, so maybe you should think about how many times, honestly, you\\u2019ve rushed her because of your rule.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI have a little quirk: whenever i eat out at a restaurant & the food is done, even if I\\u2019m not in a rush, i like to immeadiately pay the bill and leave. I dont like sitting around, waiting, digesting, taking a breath etc. Sometimes I\\u2019ll even get up and pay at the cashier just to start going quicker. I\\u2019ve always been like that, i bet a lot of people are.\\n\\nAnyway we\\u2019re on vacation with my wife, we have lunch somewhere and in my normal fashion i get up to leave as soon as our food is finished. I pay the bill & since my wife is also done i\\u2019m like lets go! We also had a train to catch in 30mins so i wanted to walk around a bit to feel lighter before a long ride. Uneventful, we waltz out.\\n\\nLater on that day we\\u2019re having food again somewhere at the destination city before checking into the hotel yet. We both finish (i\\u2019m done maybe 2min before her) so i get up and tell the waiter we\\u2019d like the check & tell my wife i gotta go to the bathroom. Disgusting detail, but eating makes your intestines work & i felt the intense need to go to the bathroom for a poop. About 12 mins later she angrily knocks on the wc door and yells at me that shes been waiting on me & we need to get to the hotel & whats been taking so long. I go oh okay sorry, quickly finish up & head out. I handle the check but she\\u2019s visibly pissed. Basically we get into an enormous fight stemming from this whole thing. \\n\\nHer point is that im a hypocrite because im always in a rush to leave except for when i needed to go to the wc and i couldve waited until we got to the hotel & not made her wait \\u201cawkwardly\\u201d for 15 min. My point is that it was a natural body reaction and really: whats the big deal? I honestly felt annoyed that i\\u2019m being timed and scolded about my dumb bowel movements.  Also its not a double standard bc i would\\u2019ve waited on her if she needed to go to the bathroom, i just dont like sitting around waiting after dinner/lunch for no reason. When you need to go to the bathroom it turns it into a different set of circumstances.\\n\\nUnimportant detail, we needed to be at the hotel by 18 so there was a very slight rush, but we did end up getting there 5 minutes earlier no problem. Its a goddamn hotel anyway, they make their money off people paying to stay in their rooms, we booked in advance, what could really happen from 15 min delay even if it had happened.\\n\\nHonestly im really struggling to see her pov, i felt like it was super unnecessary, petty & also invading my privacy. In the moment I got annoyed with her and raised my voice but honestly if i cant take a shit without being nagged at, im gonna lose my mind. If it was 30min i\\u2019d get it. Even though we made up (i apologized), she doesnt think she was wrong at all and insists that it was a double standard & i\\u2019m rude for making her wait 15min. Anyway long boring story:\\n\\nAITA for making her wait in the restaurant while i went to the bathroom? \\n\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Anyways,  back in band about my Sophomore year of high school I met this senior girl who I really liked, and it happened she just had broken up with her boyfriend.  She had just moved back from this other school nearby, and she was into gaming and what not, so I figured \\\"hey, why not give it a shot?\\\".  Well homecoming was coming up so 3 weeks out I asked her and got ecstatic when she said yes.  Than the problem came.\\n\\nMe- Oh jeez thats awesome! I'm glad you said yes!\\n\\nGirl- But  not if you  have a crush on me.\\n\\nMe- (I secretly had a crush) Oh, no no no no no... never.\\n\\nA week later at a football game which was on the anniversary of my Great Ma's death I felt very depressed, so I sat alone on the bench and did my own thing and she came up and got mad I wasn't sitting and talking with her or discussing homecoming.  I asked her to be alone cause I wasn't feeling well, and about my Great Grandma, but she said nevermind on homecoming if your gonna be depressed.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis Summer:  \\n\\nRight back into this summer after not talking for a couple years I decide to text her and apologize for being anyway or whatever I had done to upset her and offered her friendship.  This arose when I was going through a spell of me feeling awful constantly, so I tried to tie up loose ends to see if I was feeling guilt or something else from past experiences. \\n\\n   \\n\\nAfter explaining how I felt depressed she sorta got mad.\\n\\nMe-  I just  have felt depressed all the time and I want to go back and see if talking to people who I might have upset or screwed over would help if I tried making things ok again.\\n\\nGirl-  I have a doctor for depression if you want she helps with clinical depression and when I suffered it helped me a lot.  \\n\\nMe-  Oh no, I doubt I have the disease I'm just saying I've felt very depressed over the last couple months.  \\n\\nGirl-  You shouldn't use depressed willy nilly like that.  People have serious medical conditions about depression and I find it infuriating that you would ever use it that way!\\n\\nMe-  No, I meant it as a feeling not as a self diagnosis,  people use it as an adjective,  and noun constantly.  I was just describing how I felt and  it's how I felt, maybe not to a disease point but, I've felt upset.\\n\\nGirl-  I had to deal with rape, death, and abuse from all kinds of people and I actually had depression.  NO.  You are a complete asshole for ever using that word with your situation.  Apologize or I won't talk to you again.  \\n\\n\\\\*She blocked me so I couldn't say anything past this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell.  Yeah, am I the asshole here for using depressed to describe how I felt over the past couple months? \",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"So basically, my brother is 5 years older than me but a year below me in uni. My brother has been dealing with mental illness for most of his life, he has pretty bad anxiety, depression, and ADD and barely scraped out of HS with decent marks. He was in uni for a half a year before he tried to commit suicide, and after that he pulled himself out of school to focus on his mental health. This went on for years, and in this time he was really dedicated to battling depression and trying to become the best person he could be. I was fucking proud of him. \\n\\nFast forward to September, he's a 24 year-old freshman going into a Com Sci program at our local university, and I was going into my second year of Software Engineering. He said he felt really nervous being back in school and relied on me for support, and I gave it to him to the best of my ability. He found a girl in his program who he liked, some cute, fresh faced 17 year old Korean girl. They dated after talking for a while and he seemed happy, but I was grossed out that my 24 year old grownass brother was dating a teenager. I held my tongue though because this was the happiest I had seen him in years, but I wasn't happy about it.\\n\\nSo now, on Sunday she decided to break up with him because she said felt more comfortable with guys her own age and that he should move on. The motherfucker hasn't left his room in 3 days and has reverted to the same self sorry sack of shit he was before his therapy. His fucking wailing has been preventing me from studying for my midterms, and I went to his room to tell him to get over it. He continued to wail saying shit like \\\"I'm fucking worthless!\\\" and \\\"I'm gonna kill myself!\\\". I was so frustrated at him that I yelled this to him word for word \\\"SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU WORTHLESS SHIT AND DO IT FAGGOT, NO ONE FEELS BAD FOR YOU!!!\\\". I had enough of his self pity and I was angry at the fact that this guy basically wasted thousands of dollars of therapy money over some girl he knew for a couple months. \\n\\nThis was the first time I actually yelled at him and he took it to heart. He looked shocked and I quickly made sure to make myself scarce. It's been several hours now and he hasn't made a single noise from his room. He's locked the door and won't respond to my numerous apologies that I've said. AITA reddit?\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"Hi guys, \\n\\nSo this happened last night. For context, I (22M) have been dating this really cool girl for the past 4 months (22F). We have also been a friend for basically the past 4 years. We have no issue with our relationship, except with the relationship with one of my best friends (22F) who has been one of my closest friends for the past 10 years. We now have what I consider to be a platonic friendship.\\n\\nAlmost 2 years ago (before my now girlfriend and were even considering dating), we had exactly two moments where we made out, one of which where we were both in relationships - meaning we both cheated. It was bad, we know, but we were both in really bad (abusive in my case) relationships. All said nothing came out of those incidents. We discussed it, but neither of us has any romantic or sexual feelings toward the other anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo long story short, a few nights ago, this friend (who now works as a tech consultant) had to go visit a client who's office was really close to my place. The office was a 5 minutes drive from my place, v.s an hour commute from her place. Since she had to meet the client very early in the morning, she asked me if she could sleep on my couch, so that she would not have to deal with the long commute. I said that it was fine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I called my girlfriend to tell her about this she got really angry. My girlfriend feels that even though I say that the friendship between me and this friend is platonic, it is not, and what I did exhibit a lack of boundaries. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI argued that letting close friends sleep on my couch, regardless of gender is something that I've done in the past many times and she's was okay with that, but this situation is different because she doesn't like that specific friend. So the act of letting my friend crash at my place is not inherently wrong, it just feels wrong to her because she doesn't like that specific friend.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll in all, my friend slept over, my girlfriend got really angry and we had a long talk about it today, and we are now okay, but I'm left wondering, AITA?\",\n",

Back up a couple of days from now he realises that the tickets are selling for \\u00a3300+ and now suddenly he claims that the tickets are his and that he is going to sell them so him and his girlfriend can go on a romantic trip together. I have told him that he agreed that he would sell them back to me if he wasn't going to come with me to the concert and he states that they are his and he wants them now then he also said that his girlfriend will be really sad if she doesn't get the tickets, which is funny because he also said just two days ago that she doesn't know about the concert and that he had bought the tickets as he was keeping them as a valentine's present.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI was briefly romantically involved with one of my peers, he had treated me abusively before we started dating, but after I broke off things with him, he started to become clingy- especially after I started dating his older twin sister. I'm not dating her at the moment, but I've considered rekindling my romance with her. \\nHere's a quick TL: \\n\\n7th Grade: \\n\\nWe meet for the first time. I grow to like him, despite his evident narcissism and bipolarity. \\n\\nWe work on our first project together, he tells the teacher he didn't want to work with \\\"stupid bimbos\\\" (i.e. Me) \\n\\nWe join several of the same club activities, he's better than me at all of them, but I'm making more friendships than him. He starts conflicts with me for being self-centered and detracting from his skill. \\n\\n8th Grade: \\n\\nHe starts to openly hate me after I text him and ask him for his help with some homework, and uses the texts as \\\"receipts\\\", even thought there is nothing to expose. \\n\\nI try to gain his friendship by extending kindness and generosity with him. He declines. \\n\\nI meet his twin sister for the first time, we are both involved in the same choir group. We quickly become friends and audition for a school musical together. \\n\\nHe stops talking to me after seeing that I'm friends with his sister. \\n\\nHe shows up for the opening day of the musical, and stops me during intermission. He gropes my butt through my costume for this musical, and when I tell him off, he shrugs and walks off. \\n\\nHe boos during one of my solos during the musical, only for me to stop and look shocked. He's smiling widely. \\n\\nHis sister and I start hanging out as casual friends. \\n\\n9th Grade: \\n\\nMakes up a rumor about me getting herpes, and develops a crush on one of my close friends. \\n\\nWe're involved in an activity together, and he totally crushes me at State, but gets pissed when I don't seem to care. \\n\\nContinues to call me stupid and goes out of his way to insult me. \\n\\nCalls his sister and I lesbians when we go to Homecoming together. \\n\\nHe's popular at this point for his intelligence and talent, while I'm known for my boldness and outgoing personality. We seem to be in two different worlds at this points. \\n\\nOver the summer, I take a year of math to be in the same class as him, but he also accelerates. \\n\\n10th Grade:\\n\\nStarts to hang out with my friend, he's evidently interested in her, but she's not. \\n\\nI start hanging out at his house because of his sister, and sometimes come over to babysit his younger sister. \\n\\nHe goes on to be invited to conferences for his musical ability, while I'm more focused on solidifying my ACT Score. \\n\\nHe pushes me down his basement stairs when I'm hanging out with his sister, and then locks me down there for 4 hours. \\n\\nAsks me to go to Homecoming with him that year, but I go with his sister. \\n\\n11th Grade: \\n\\nBoos me when I perform my instrument at a school function, frowns when I don't stop. \\n\\nGrabs my breast after we leave eyeshot, after I tell him off, he throws up. He was drunk. \\n\\nHe gets drunk several times this year and I try having an intervention with him, but he's very inappropriate about it. \\n\\nHe tries having sex with me, but I'm still confused about my sexuality, and while I think he's cute, I think his sister is cuter. \\n\\nHe makes up rumors about my friend that he likes, and then goes to prom with her. \\n\\nI tell her about these rumors before prom, but she goes with him anyways. \\n\\nHe rips out my hair extensions at prom after he sees me with his sister. \\n\\nHe makes up a rumor about my friend being a prostitute for her talent after prom and her reputation is ruined.\\n\\nHe loses a lot of his friends at this point, and he's spiraling down. \\n\\n12th Grade: \\n\\nWe date for two months, before I realize he's making up rumors about ME to our mutual friends. \\n\\nI break things off. \\n\\nWe stop talking. My relationship with his sister is strained. \\n\\nOver spring break, I drive another friend over state borders so she can get an abortion, and then uses this to make politically charged comments about me. \\n\\nAt prom, he throws punch at me and makes a comment about abortion. \\n\\nWhen I give a graduation speech, he interrupts it to call me a baby-killer, and since I went to high school in a conservative state, I get booed off of stage. \\n\\nInstead of confronting him normally, I drag him to the parking lot and start to throw hands. \\n\\nUniversity: \\n\\nWe go to the same university. \\n\\nI get in touch with his sister and date her for two years. We end the relationship on a positive note about two months ago. \\n\\nHe starts to get in touch with me, sending me a dick pic last week. \\n\\nHis sister messages me and I tell her about the picture. \\n\\nShe asks me to send it to her. \\n\\nI do.\\n\\nShe shows her parents and he gets in trouble. \\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(I wasn't home and she didn't take anything) Because of this I did not feel safe in this town so I left. I left rather quickly and on the night before I left I discovered a library book I had failed to return. My friend volunteered to return it for me. I agreed as it was late and I did not want to stop at the library on my way to the airport in the morning.\\nFast forward four months: I had kept in contact with this friend, we talked once or twice a week. I had asked once, about a week after I left it she had returned the book and she said she would soon. I dropped it figuring she would take care of it. Then, last week, I got a bill from the library totalling $90 dollars. \\nI was shocked and called her, I at first thought my friend had dropped it off and they failed to properly scan it back into the system. I was wrong. My friend had never returned it. I asked her if she could, if not I said, I could have my sibling who lived in the same town pick it up from her and drop it off. My friend said they could drop it off, it had just skipped her mind. Then she asked if I wanted help paying the bill, money was tight for this person so I said if they wanted to pay half it would be greatly appreciated. \\nKeep in mind, this person volunteered to return the book in the first place, and asked if I wanted help paying.\\nI sent her a text a few minutes after our phone conversation to thank her for helping pay the fee.  It didn't go through, she blocked me. She also blocked me on sc, insta, and messenger. \\nIt's been a week and she still hasn't returned the book.\\nAm I the asshole here?? Did I somehow overstep myself? \",\n",

That's not an age where someone can make that kind of decision. And your parents let him, cause hey, it's still in the family. Even more of an heirloom now, because you've both had it and someday so will all their grandchildren. \\n\\nSince you're grown and this is an heirloom for the BABIES (first when your brother is born, then when you are born) they probably thought it obvious you'd give it to your niece/nephew. They aren't being assholes asking for and/or encouraging you to give it up.\\n\\nI get the sentimental attachment seeing as how it's your connection to home. I really do. And no you're not the asshole ... you \\\"couldn't say no\\\" in the first place, and even if you had, it *is* yours now and you have a right to keep it.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nYou *are* grown, and although you will be sad and miss your teddy if you give it up.... you'll get over it quickly. Worst that could happen is you feel sad for a couple weeks, and then proud every time you see that baby with your bear and know you carried on a tradition for them.\\n\\nAnd if you refuse? I doubt your brother will understand why. People  tend to view that sort of thing as \\\"oh so a stuffed animal is more important than my kid\\\" and get pretty pissed/defensive.\\n\\nYou and I both know that's not true, and your brother prolly does too.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo a little bit of background: This girl is no longer my girlfriend, but the way the relationship ended has been bugging me lately and I\\u2019m posting on here mostly to make sure I did the right thing. So into the fight that caused me to end things. My girlfriend was over at my parents place one night I was 19 at the time and she was 20 hence why I was at my parents and this was before I went to Uni. Anyways she brings up that I never pay enough when we go out and always complain about money when we\\u2019re out, and that I was being an insensitive asshole about her living situation\\u2014which to be fair to her she did have a really shitty living situation. But also to be fair to me I would very frequently try to pay for her meals when money would allow, but I had other obligations that caused me to not be able to spend every penny on her. So sometimes if money was tight for me I would ask if we could split the bill, I mean at the time I was a community college student so I wasn\\u2019t rolling in money! She would usually say yes to this, but then make me feel guilty about it later and say how she really can\\u2019t do stuff like that since she doesn\\u2019t have very much money. Now also for context sake, she would always pick the restaurant, she was an incredibly picky eater and say that if we didn\\u2019t go to get either wings or Olive Garden she would get stomach issues. I would have made food for her or gone to cheaper places and been fine with paying, but because of her food restrictions I wasn\\u2019t really able to see these options through. Anyways I explain to her pretty much what I\\u2019ve already said that the options she chose to eat where typically expensive and that because of certain situations I wasn\\u2019t able to give every cent I had to our expensive food excursions. I\\u2019m not quite sure where she would get that I complained about money? But she also accused me of being insensitive to her living situation and that I should try to pay for her more\\u2014which I already was. Anyways I say this and her response in my opinion at this point turns incredibly venomous and says that she should go back to her ex cause at least he paid for things. Now she had told me at multiple times that this ex had abused her, and this really pissed me off when she said she should go back to him. As I never did anything in my opinion eliciting that kind of response. So I made a pretty heated remark back and said. \\u201cFine go ahead and go back to the guy that used to beat you, because clearly he knew how to treat you.\\u201d At this point I was at my breaking point because she had done a lot of other manipulative things that caused me to really question the relationship. Just for a quick example I never asked her to stop being friends with her guy friends even when she went out to Compton until 3 in the morning with a co-worker who had been chasing after her pretty hard early into our relationship. She\\u2019d always talk about how gross the guy was, but I always had the suspicion something happened that night. Especially since she got mad about me not hanging out with her as I was studying for an exam that night, so I think she went with him to get my attention. As I write this I can\\u2019t believe I didn\\u2019t break up with her sooner. And another example she couldn\\u2019t stand any girls I would hang out with that she deemed prettier than her. And I never did anything remotely resembling cheating behavior. Anyways back to the the main argument.  After a long dialogue about me using info she had trusted me with to hurt her I said I was done. This led to a huge argument after which we broke up. Apologies for any grammar mistakes or vagueness. Anyways Reddit what do you think am I the asshole \\n\\nTL;DR AITA for telling my ex girlfriend to go back to her abusive ex boyfriend. \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "        \"selftext\": \"First off obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile.\\n\\nSo to preface my situation me and my roommate live in an old art gallery, that was turned into an apartment. The apartment doesn\\u2019t have real walls for the bedrooms, they are more like dividers, so anything that goes on in the apartment we can hear. It\\u2019s caused some problems in the past, as we have learned to adjust but this takes the cake.\\n\\nSo about a month ago me and her had gone out with some friends, and I went home early expressing that I had to work in the morning, and was going to bed. About 2 hours later she brings everyone back to our house, drink as fuck at this point, to smoke some weed. Being a drunk group of people they were loud enough to interrupt my sleep, so I go an ask if they could quiet down. I had to ask three times, before finally I decided to just ask them to either shut up or leave. They go , she apologized the next day and it was fine. So I thought.\\n\\nAbout a week later she brings a group over again, must be about 2am. I try to ignore them because I hate being that Bitch that tells everyone to leave. About 30 minutes to by of them loudly chatting and decide it\\u2019s time to ask for them to quiet down or leave. They go , we move on again. I feel like at that point she should understand the boundaries. Well no.\\n\\nSo last night she brings a friend over I wanna day around 2am again. Them coming in woke me up which frustrated me because I had to be up at 7am for an appointment. So I go and ask if they could just please be quiet and I had to sleep. They decide to go to bed, I get to sleep all is well. \\n\\nSo today I went up to her just to discuss how often this has been occurring, and ask if she could be more respectful of when I\\u2019m trying to rest. (Note I almost always use headphones at home , never have people over late , just generally do my best to be respectful). She starts to get mad saying that I bring people over at night and it doesn\\u2019t upset her, so why am I upset. Saying that we both knew the situation when we moved in, and just generally not wanting to change her habits. I was trying to ask her if we could just compromise, and she just got mad saying \\u201cI just want to be able to do what I want\\u201d, and \\u201cI\\u2019ve never had roommates who cared.\\u201d Pointing out to when we would hangout at her old place, before we were roommates, up late drinking and partying. \\n\\nI feel bad because I know she\\u2019s not used to a situation where her roommates had a problem with this, but I also don\\u2019t want to just sit in my room angry and awake whenever this happens. Am I wrong for asking her to not have people over so late ? Is there a way I should go about this differently?\",\n",

But basically he said stress has been rising due to school starting and that class in particular. I also suspect some of his family stuff caused stress(going through a rough time, a family member is sick). He also says that he gets very scared when I hit my head (I'm the dumbass for continuing to horse around like that so I take blame there). So the fear of me hitting my head and the stress all came out. \\n\\nHe said when we play around and I hit my head he's usually calmer, and he is. I didn't know the stress surrounding me hitting my head was as severe until now, because he never went into full details all I knew was that he had head injuries when he was younger. This time because of the added stress and the fear of me hitting my head everything amplified and he just kind of snapped. He said he could feel something \\\"bubbling up\\\" (he mentioned he was irritated before this happened, but he didn't go into details why). And he says he should have blown off steam.\\n\\nWe're remaining friends, were gonna focus on ourselves or whatever. Gonna keep in contact while we are improving ourselves.. I still feel bad in a way, I feel like im to blame partially and I know I am. I still don't know how to feel, still don't know if im the asshole. I guess I just want to hear opinions\\n\",\n",

It felt like I was forcing myself to like her when I only really wanted to be friends. So I talked to her and it ended with both of us seeming to be okay. We still wanted to be friends (we played games together with other friends and didn\\u2019t want to ruin that) we are both uni students, everything seemed to be fine. We have this mutual \\u2018friend\\u2019 who doesn\\u2019t live near us however he\\u2019s a little older than us by about 3 years and has a job and doesn\\u2019t live so far that he can\\u2019t drive up. I found out earlier today that they met up with another gaming friend of ours in the same town last weekend, a meet up which I wasn\\u2019t invited too (apparently because they didn\\u2019t think I\\u2019d be interested) during the meet up this \\u201cfriend\\u201d slept with my ex. He seems to feel no remorse and she seems to think it wouldn\\u2019t bother me. Am I justifiably angry at the both of them for this less than 2 weeks after the break up or am I being unjust as I ended it and I\\u2019m not together with her anymore. After I was told I blew up at them and sent a few rude messages which probably wasn\\u2019t the best way to handle it. But it felt like I was betrayed by 2 of the few friends I actually have. AITA for being mad at them or should I just apologise and try and continue being friends? \",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nIn my history course in college, we're doing our Cold War unit and the Cold War is my professor's favorite era of history. He was actually alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis and he talks a lot about how \\\"exciting\\\" it was to be that close to nuclear annihilation. A lot of us students think he's really weird and we all think that he has some weird fetish about nuclear war.\\n\\nAnyway, he'd do that usual teacher thing where he'll ask a question for the whole class and when nobody answers, he'll pick out a student that he thinks isn't paying any attention. He ended up asking who was the leader of the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis and he picked on me. I had no clue, so I just took a shot in the dark. I said \\\"Gorbachev\\\" and my professor said \\\"Wrong! Now can I get an answer from someone who isn't a complete moron?\\\" Who the fuck was he to insult me like that. I stood out of my desk and yelled at him \\\"Not everyone knows everything about the Cold War, you hunch-backed motherfucker!\\\" The professor then yells at me to leave the classroom and he said \\\"I wish Russia HAD nuked us so that little shits like you couldn't be born!\\\" I ended up going to see the assistant dean and I told him all about the incident. He was more upset about me cussing at the teacher and now I'm academically suspended because of it. When I told him about the professor calling me a moron, he simply said \\\"Well boo-hoo for you.\\\"\\n\\nSo here comes the obvious question: Who's the asshole here?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "        \"selftext\": \"This is my first time here so please let me know if I have done anything wrong!\\n\\n# Background information\\n\\nMy wife (let's call her Wendy) is graduated from college and works an hourly job (that doesn't use her degree) to support us while I finish undergraduate studies before starting medical school this fall.  We got married a few years ago, and her twin sister (let's call her Claire) was furious that my wife got married before her, and told her several times how stupid it was to get married so young, etc etc (my wife changed religions from what my sister does for church and there is a lot of tension over that choice and the different customs and beliefs).  \\n\\nMy wife and I will be moving in a few months and will have several large expenses including purchasing supplies for me to enter medical school (read, a new laptop/tablet to use for my studies), and maybe a nice vacation before we take out thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars in loans come fall.\\n\\nWell my wife's twin, let's call her Claire, graduated from nursing school last year and is now full-time at a hospital in her state. She is getting married in October and Wendy and I will have to fly out for that, hotels etc etc etc. \\n\\n# * * Here's the actual story * *\\n\\nDue to Wendy (my wife) Claire (her twin) and Jamie (their childhood best friend) all becoming older, someone had the idea to do a girl's weekend in March to get together before everyone has kids and has big jobs and families etc. One last hurrah before they all become full adults and stuff. Jamie and Claire are both nurses, graduated, and live by themselves and have no problem spending several hundred for a big week of fun. \\n\\nMy wife and I are in a different boat. My wife is graduated but doesn't have a job that uses her degree (makes 12.50 an hour). We still live like students, and with several big expenses coming up this year with the move to medical school, don't have several hundred dollars to spend on this trip. We have a sizable amount in savings but that isn't something we want to dip in to for a trip like this, especially considering that my wife Wendy will be in Claire's wedding in October anyways (and so will their childhood best friend Jamie). \\n\\nSince the other two have big jobs and are done with school this seems like no big deal to them: they have wanted to go somewhere tropical like Florida to get some warmth and get away.\\n\\nThis isn't something that my wife and I have a problem with, it is just that we are in a different place financially and in life right now (in 10 years we will be making more than both of them put together, but that's a long long ways away). My wife has voiced concerns but her sister has repeatedly made snide and rude remarks such as \\\"if it costs too much just don't go\\\" or \\\"this is what you work for\\\" and \\\"don't you have savings?\\\". \\n\\nTo be fair, we live comfortably as students. I also work on the side and we aren't scraping by by any means. However, we do so by being careful in not spending more than we make and by being prudent with savings. I believe that my sister-in-law Claire knows all of this and knows how we live and so can easily say \\\"why don't you spend the same as we do considering you are doing okay\\\".\\n\\nI get why she would think that we could do so. However, with so many large expenses on the horizon my wife and I are very very hesitant to drop hundreds. We would be okay with her spending less than $150 on a plane ticket if her friend and sister could help cover the hotel and car costs. But when their friend Jamie started to offer to help, the sister texted my wife privately to tell her that my wife should pay it all herself, that since she makes most of the money in our marriage it is her money anyways and that I shouldn't be able to make these types of decisions for her. \\n\\nThis is where my wife was told \\\"if it costs too much then don't come\\\".  \\n\\n# AITA \\n\\nAITA for us being hesitant to spend lots of money on this? We have so many big expenses this year we just don't want to drop hundreds more when we have a move several states away, some new furniture and electronics to buy, possibly a vacation of our own to have before selling our souls in debt, and then paying for my wife to travel to the wedding in October anyways (which will cost lots more than this girls week trip).\\n\\nYes, this is probably one of the last times to have these \\\"3 amigas\\\" get together and my wife is super disappointed we aren't in a position for this to be an easy  'yes'.  However, we also want to look at starting a family this year and my wife's sister told her \\\"well if you aren't okay spending money on this trip then maybe you shouldn't be looking at starting a family then\\\".  \\n\\n# *Bonus* \\n\\nWill I be an asshole by texting her sister personally to tell her how much of a fucking bitch she is? Am I an asshole for calling her out on something that is \\\\*technically\\\\* just between my wife and her sister, even if she is incredibly rude to my wife and makes her cry?\\n\\n# TL;DR\\n\\nTL;DR Wife's sister in a much better position than we are financially as we are students. Wants my wife to join in on a several hundred dollar girls weekend before life and families become the norm. However due to finances, my wife and I are hesitant and would only be okay spending a small amount, and only then if the sister and best friend helped with a car and hotel. My wife's sister has said several rude things to us, and while this is the only chance for a trip of its kind, there are several huge expenses my wife and I face this year including going to a massive wedding for the same sister this Fall.\\n\\nAITA?\",\n",

I didn't come from a well off family like most of my college friends did, and I often feel, whether justly or unjustly, that I have not been afforded the same opportunities that they have throughout our lives.\\n\\nI was talking with a friend earlier, and I found out that one of her parents is a high level executive at a HUGE company, one of those companies that everybody has heard of. This is, unfortunately, quite common among my friends, because we went to a pretty wealthy school that I was only able to attend because of a hefty scholarship and tens of thousands of dollars of debt to repay.\\n\\nThis, admittedly, makes me feel rather insignificant, because nobody in my family has ever been in that kind of position, or had that kind of money, but many of my friends have lived this way for all or most of their lives.\\n\\nMy friend knows how I feel about this. It's not really a secret. I was already feeling a bit down and I said \\\"Wow, I'd really love to have a position like that. I'm just not sure I'll ever be able to do it... Do you think I'll ever get there?\\\"\\n\\nShe replied \\\"I don't know,\\\" and that was it. Nothing about \\\"if you work hard...\\\" or \\\"I think you could,\\\" or even \\\"if you play your cards right.\\\" Just \\\"I don't know.\\\" I asked what she meant and she just said \\\"nobody can see the future. I'm not going to lie and say that I think you'll make it\\\"\\n\\nOkay? In my mind, this is a clear opportunity to try to encourage me when I'm feeling like a complete nobody, and she turned it around to say \\\"ehh you might make, it you might not, who cares?\\\"\\n\\nWas she being brutally honest and I just need to accept it?\\n\\nTL;DR I'm in a much worse financial situation than my friend, which makes me sad. I asked if she ever thinks I could be in a position that would give me a good financial situation, and she said she didn't know because nobody can see the future.\",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nFirst, throwaway account. Backstory: I have recently started dating a girl that I had been messaging for about a year. I am absolutely in love with this girl. She's smart, beautiful, funny, caring, and all around perfect. However, her background is not exactly spotless. She has been in a relationship with a man for 12 years. But for 7 of those years, she has had a casual sexual relationship with a guy that I knew many years ago. To be clear, this guy is truly despicable. He's bipolar, a drug addict, has never been able to hold down a job, and still lives with his parents at 37 years old. On top of that, he's about 5'2\\\", 120 lbs soaking wet, with greasy hair and yellowed teeth. \\n\\nHe has in the past physically assaulted her, had her thrown in jail, vandalized her boyfriend's car, and threatened to burn down her house.  Despite all of this, she continued to see him, and even regularly paid his bar tabs and bought him drugs. When I learned about this relationship, she insisted that they had not been intimate for at least 6 months. I subsequently found out that wasn't true. Even after he learned of our relationship, he would show up at her work and call her constantly. She even exited my car one night and immediately called him to pick her up and take her to a bar she used to frequent and lied to me about it right up until I walked up to her there. I said that if she wanted to be with me, she would have to make it clear that their relationship and friendship was over completely and permanently. She refused several times. I demanded that she block him on her phone and all social media before we could be together. She refused. It wasn't until he called her one morning and broke it off with her that she finally acquiesced and blocked him. \\n\\nIn addition, she used to hang out with two large 50 year old black drug dealers. These men are not good or bright people. She used to buy drugs from them and they will call and text her constantly with bizarre and inappropriate messages. She would regularly go to the same bar with them. Her contact with them has caused two major fights so far. So again, I asked her to cut off all contact with them and block them on her phone and across all social media. \\n\\nI understand these facts do not paint a pretty picture of her, but she really is a truly wonderful person, is not proud of this stuff, and says regularly that she wants to pursue a relationship and be different. But whenever I have asked her to block these people I have met fierce resistence. I tried to make it clear that I was not trying to control her or who she associates with. I was simply setting standards for myself and who I date.

I play trombone in the band and I've rented a French horn to learn, which means every Monday and Wednesday I carry a trombone on my right shoulder with my hand to secure the strap (case has backpack straps and I use one since I have an actual backpack too) and the horn in my left. Now, I know this light. If you don't press the button button before the light turns green, even if it's a half second late, the hand doesn't turn into the green walking guy, but the light still will be green for over a minute. I get to the light right as it turns green, and obviously my hands are full so there's no realistic chance of me pressing the button. I look both ways and walk. Then, I hear a loud engine and someone laying into their horn. I turn to see this speeding black car racing towards me and slightly drifting towards the curb but not signaling. Given that I just walked past a bar, I take a couple steps back to position the light pole thing between myself and the car ( I only had taken a couple steps into the crosswalk) as a precaution. The driver slams his break in the middle of the crosswalk, makes an angry gesture towards the red hand, drives extra slowly until he's out of the crosswalk, and then zips away. Now this confused me because whenever I drive, I always look for pedestrians, light or no light. I get that the walk signal is somewhat for my safety but do drivers really rely so heavily on it?\\n\\nTL;DR I walked technically on a red light even though the traffic light would stay green for a long time, angry driver honks at me\",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI am not asking whether I will be the asshole in some hypothetical future conflict. Does having my philosophy make me an asshole?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLong read ahead:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMaterial things are more valuable to me than humans. I'm a pretty passive person. I would never purposely harm anyone. The reasoning behind my philosophy is that interpersonal relationships are more expendable/replaceable than material objects. To be fair, I'm too young to get a job or income. My parents have provided me with a comfortable middle class lifestyle, but they never spent their income on what I wanted.\\n\\nThe value of something is determined by its scarcity. For me, money is extremely difficult to come by. I've lived my entire life outclassed by my peers in terms of money (clothing, vacations, shoes, airpods, etc.). Whenever I go to school, there are over a thousand students. People are a dime a dozen. All replaceable. Like cattle. Like vermin. Humans multiply quickly as well. 9 months is all it takes for another one to be created. Another superfluous piece of biomass I have to share this planet with.\\n\\n Contrast that with my possessions. I have an unusual hobby that I won't name for anonymity. The stuff I buy for my hobby is far more exotic and rare than any human. In addition, they (my possessions) never move away, get angry, grow to hate me, or die. All things that humans are prone to, unfortunately. \\n\\nEmotional investment in objects is far less risky than humans. In addition, you can't tell if your friend you've been talking to for years hates you behind your back. If people were riskless investments, the divorce rate wouldn't be 50%. \\n\\n\\\"What about your parents/family??\\\", you moral philosophers say. I don't have a high opinion of either. Your parents are literally chosen for you and you have no choice in the matter. Do some research about the [veritable cocktail of hormones](http://files.webb.uu.se/uploader/271/BIOKand-13-027-Lagerlof-Jessica-Sammanfattning.pdf) that make reproduction and child rearing possible.\\n\\n **I would hardly call any affection from relatives genuine when their behavior is written into their genes, not to mention the consequences of abusing/neglecting your child. It's like commending your butler for quick service because you're holding them at gunpoint**. They have no choice and neither do you. Also they dislike me as a person, so why should I feel anything for them. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'm sorry to everyone that I have harmed due to my social incompetence and failure at everything of consequence.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nThis is a throw away account to protect privacy. \\n\\nSorry for formatting, I am on my phone. \\n\\nTLDR: my mother made light of a person's eminent death, implied that I could gain from his death, then acted shocked and appalled when I called her out on her inappropriate comment. \\n\\n*this was a text conversation. I wish I had screenshots. But in a (failed) effort to not obsess about the situation, I deleted the messages. But trust me, I read them over and over, thinking maybe I missed something, miss read or overreacted. It was a rather short convo that ended in her making me out to be the asshole in the situation and then saying \\\"I am done with this convo\\\"*\\n\\nSome background. \\nMy (late) aunt used to live in a cute little cottage house. I mentioned to my mother than I liked my aunts house and wished I knew how to get in contact with the landlord, as maybe he had another similar property available. \\nAfter my aunt passed, a friend of hers (R) took over the lease. \\n\\nFast forward to today, my mother sends me a copy & paste of a message she received from R's daughter. Rs daughter is informing everyone that R is in the hospital, with serious heart problems, clots, etc. Has had serious surgeries and is being moved from ICU to a hospice care facility. She is asking for money as they cannot pay medical bills, or any bills, and is also stressed about having to move him out of his house (that my aunt previously lived in, remember). She asks for prayers and is clearly upset and in a bad situation, also, her father is not in good shape. \\n\\nSo, after my mother send me that, she sends me this. \\n\\n\\\"Just saying....now you can live in Aunt ____ 's house \\ud83d\\ude09\\\" \\n\\nI am immediately shocked. I think, what an awful thing to say. To make light of his dying, and to imply that I can gain from his death. I text back\\n\\n\\\"Mom.....he is dying.....\\\" hoping that she will get that I think her comment was in appropriate without me having to actually say so. But no, that didnt work. \\n\\nShe replied with \\\"I know and I am praying for him \\ud83d\\ude4f\\ud83d\\ude4c. But I am just saying, maybe you can check it out. I am not a bad person.\\\" \\n\\nAre you sure? That seems an awful lot like something a bad person would say??\\n\\nSo I message back \\\"I know that what you said was meant as a joke, but it was a shitty one. I hope you do not make jokes like this very often. You made light of their situation, of his death, and implied I could gain from it. That comment lacked compassion and was not OK.\\\" \\n\\nTo which she exploded. She said that I should know her better than to think that she thought that. That she is a good person who cares for human life, and would never joke about it. That I should know her better and basically trying to gaslight and make me out to be a bad person for thinking that she thought those things (even tho she does think those things, so much so that she texted them to me). \\n\\nAm I the asshole? Did I overreact? What did i miss?\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I brought the issue up with my ex and I asked him if he could invite someone else the next time he hangs out with her so the two of them won't be alone together. He got mad at me when I brought it up and said that I was preventing him from hanging out with his friends and that I didn't trust him enough.\\n\\nBack to the story, when he told me he was going to date her I told him I didn't want to be friends anymore. It just felt like he betrayed my trust, even though we weren't dating anymore, because back then I specifically adressed the issue and he told me I shouldn't be concerned about her. \\n\\nSo now I don't talk to him anymore, but I'm still wondering did I overreact and AITA for my reaction?\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"TLDR is at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nWhen I was 15 I had my morals tested like no 15 year old ever should.\\n\\nAround this time, after my family had come back from a holiday, my mother told my father that she wasn't happy in the relationship, and wanted to leave. He was very sad due to this, and it was odd to see him cry because I had never seen it before. But he was sceptical, so one night he followed her when she went out for a drive. He saw her cheating on him with another guy, please note that my parents had also been married for 30 years.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe sadness turned into anger, and rightfully so, he started destroying all photos in the house that contained her in it. My mother went to live with her parents when she noticed that he knew about this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy father earned about 4 to 5 times more than my mother, and she would not be able to live on her own if she left the marriage at any point. My dad was an asshole, I don't think he ever hit my mother (although he did hit my brother and I with his hands and sometimes a belt), but his personality was disgusting. He was strict and old-fashioned with his ways of discipline towards my brother and I, and always focused on telling us what we did wrong instead of what we did right, as a child it just brought me down. My father had a horrible personality.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI chose to live with my mother 5 days a week, and with my father 2 days a week. My reasoning was this:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**\\\"I will never justify the actions of my mother, although she was in a tough financial situation and couldn't live alone if she left my father. I choose to live with my mother because she was kind-hearted and always there for her kids emotionally. My father was an asshole. I don't justify my mother's actions, I'm in a predicament choosing between two wrongs, but I have to go with my mother.\\\"**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy father disliked the fact that me and my brother hardly visited him, and chose our mother over him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn a different dispute 1 year later, my father virtually embarrassed my brother in front of his girlfriend, telling him off for living at his girlfriend's house in their garage. My dad didn't understand why he did this. Why would he choose to live in a garage over my house? My dad was either an oblivious person to the wrong he did, or he was devious, very well knowing what he did wrong but lying about it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter that dispute, my brother never saw my father again, and has not seen him for years.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnother year passes and I also hit my limit. Please note it's been 2 years of visiting my father on the weekends. I didn't like him, I didn't want to visit him, I visited out of obligation and the fact that I felt bad for leaving him all alone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe'd have arguments every single weekend when I'd visit. It was 2 years of this, he'd call my mother a slut in front of me, he'd call her a cow, any word in the book. We'd also have arguments about all sorts of stuff, including one time when I came out and told him I didn't believe in God, he told me he was disappointed in me. Do note I was raised a Catholic and only went to private schools.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter those two years, I called him up one day and told him I didn't love him, I was not obligated to love him just because he was my father, he treated my family like shit, and that I never want to see him again. He continued to argue, and after 40 minutes, the call ended. I have not seen or spoken to my father ever since.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDo note this took place 2 or so months after I turned 17. The experience as a whole really challenged my morals, and I always wondered, was there any right way to go about it? I had to choose between two wrongs, but I sympathise with my mother more than my father because of who she is. I will never justify someone cheating, even in a situation like this, I think it's disgusting regardless of the situation, but the context behind this surely makes it less of a wrong to cheat in this situation (although it's still not justified in my opinion).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy father lost all 3 of his family members, one at a time, with a year gap in between them all. But never thought he was in the wrong.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do you think I should have done?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAm I the asshole for choosing my mother, who was a good person and treated her kids well, although she cheated on my father? Or should I have chosen my father? Even though he was a dick of a person, but got cheated on?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR -** My parents were married for 30 years. Mother was a good person, earned 4-5 times less than my father, couldn't live on her own if she got divorced, she cheated on my father. Father was a shitty person with pretty bad old fashioned views, but didn't cheat on anyone. I chose to be with my mother and left my father, although I still to this very day don't justify my mother's actions. Am I the asshole?\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"I belong to one of those wedding groups where they criticize camo wedding dresses and neon yellow bridesmaid dresses and whatnot. They post screenshots of crazy wedding related things. There was a post about someone with two kids who started a go fund me to raise $300 for a venue deposit and they\\u2019d pay the rest of the venue/food/dress cost with their tax return. \\n\\nSo that\\u2019s already problematic. Considering a deposit of that size the venue itself and everything will probably cost $1500+. Generally everyone was saying \\u201cif they don\\u2019t even have $300 to their name why is their primary focus on a wedding\\u201d\\n\\nEspecially with two kids. One trip to urgent care or needing new brakes on your car will completely dry that money up. Tons of people were saying that. But when I repeated that exact thing and said if I had less than 3 grand in my savings I\\u2019d panic and never consider spending that much (half of my savings) on a wedding someone said I was an ass.\\n\\nWhy me being singled out idk. I\\u2019m not blind to poverty and struggles. I see a lot of my friends struggle to get by. I safely have a couple grand in my bank account. So YES. I would be panicking if I didn\\u2019t have that money. My total bills a month come to about $1300. That\\u2019s two months of bills and a small safety net Incase my car needs work or I have a medical issue. I obsessively check my credit score and make sure my bills were paid even though they are auto paid. With enough left to comfortably have enough gas money and can go shopping and enjoy any play money. I wasn\\u2019t \\u201cflexing\\u201d as they called it. I live modestly and within the means of my salary.(and yes I\\u2019m aware that \\u201cliving within your means\\u201d is not the key to success\\u201d it just so happened that I got a better job right around the time my bills a month increased) I only bought a new car because I could. I drove a 2001 focus for 7 years and it overheated if it sat in traffic for more than 2 minutes. Before my current job I worked part time for less than $800 a month. I get it. \\n\\nSo yes, I\\u2019m fully aware people live paycheck to paycheck. But being called an asshole and ignorant because i said $300 is not a good safety net to be spending all foreseeable money  on a wedding reception that isn\\u2019t mandatory and crowd funding for it doesn\\u2019t seem responsible.\\n\\nPeople deserve to have nice things. You shouldnt shame poor people for wanting and having nice things. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole for literally just saying I\\u2019d panic if I didn\\u2019t have 3 grand let alone $300. I guess I\\u2019m looking for people\\u2019s opinions on financial stuff. I feel like it\\u2019s taboo anymore to acknowledge you \\u201cdo okay\\u201d finances wise. More and More I see people just down others throats. Same girl told another commenter her life must be \\u201ccharming\\u201d because she agreed having $300  to your name isn\\u2019t a lot and a full blown wedding shouldn\\u2019t be a focus. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t really care that much I get some people have other opinions but I\\u2019ve increasingly see people be \\u201cshamed\\u201d (rolls eyes at that term) for being lower to average middle class and just doing \\u201cokay\\u201d\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"My apologies ahead of time for the incredible length and possible bad formatting, as I\\u2019m mobile.\\n\\nSome context:\\nThis weekend (evening of 1/25-1/27), my husband\\u2019s parents came to town to visit us and my husband\\u2019s brother & fianc\\u00e9 (both boys live within 10min of each other, a fact that will be covered in \\u201cAdditional Context\\u201d, also, the trip here is 2.5hrs one way, so not crazy far from their house). They got a hotel more or less smack between the two homes thanks to points my FIL earns due to his frequent work travel. Our home is the default place where meetups would occur, due to my BIL & future SIL\\u2019s living arrangements, and I would normally not have a single problem with this...\\nBut this is where a kink is thrown into the mix. Sunday (1/20), I began to get a throat tickle, and by Monday night I was full blown sick (cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, fever, etc., etc.). My husband notifies his parents of this and they decide to come anyway, because they don\\u2019t think their hotel is refundable or reschedulable. Again, I\\u2019m fine with this, because I\\u2019ll just sit it out, right? By Wednesday (1/23), I\\u2019m so sick that I\\u2019m at my doc and getting diagnosed with raging bronchitis, and overnight it becomes so bad that I nearly go to urgent care due to my inability to breathe but thankfully was able to reach my doc to have more meds called in. Still, the parents are coming. Cool. Cool cool cool cool.\\n\\nFurther context:\\nI generally *tolerate* my MIL and my FIL is mostly silent most of the time, so, again, tolerating him is mostly doable. However, it truly is just tolerating them, because of the treatment of my husband his entire life (verbal and physical abuse til adulthood, verbal and emotional abuse continues, also she\\u2019s a narcissist who throws tantrums the likes of which I\\u2019ve never even seen toddlers throw). We lived with them briefly til just after the holidays 2017-2018, because of a \\u201cfinal straw\\u201d incident where the lives of all the animals in the house were put at risk due to her behavior, physical violence was threatened toward us, all of which spiraled into the single worst tantrum I\\u2019ve ever seen her throw, which was compounded by my BIL & his fianc\\u00e9 getting involved in the argument, calling both of us all manner of names. We moved as quickly as we had enough money and did not speak to my BIL & fianc\\u00e9 til thanksgiving 2018, though my husband began speaking to his mom (and occasionally his dad) maybe 6-8wks after we gtfo. Both brothers moved to the same area of town and we literally had no clue we were living so close til this past weekend.\\n\\nNote:\\nSkip to Sunday if you\\u2019d like the majority of the action/issue.\\n\\nThe situation:\\nWhen they arrived Friday evening (1/25), we were told the BIL wanted to go to a particular plant based restaurant that, to me, seemed unnecessarily bougie, not to mention a good drive from the house (35min, lots of tolls). My MIL brought a bunch of food she\\u2019d made us, and while I\\u2019m helping her put it away, I tell her there\\u2019s a tea house in town I think she might enjoy (she *loves* tea), and that they have more kinds of tea than I\\u2019ve ever seen a single store/cafe carry, all of which she can also buy. She excitedly says she\\u2019d love to check it out, and I mention maybe we can do it tomorrow or Sunday if I\\u2019m feeling a little better. She enthusiastically agrees. The BIL was late arriving to our house, where we were meeting, which is common. We all had pleasant convo while waiting for him, and because I was still sick, plus I had no interest in paying stupid prices for a veggie burger, I sat this one out. BIL\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9 didn\\u2019t come coz she was tired. Husband comes home late that night and says he hopes I can come tomorrow. I tell him I\\u2019ll see, but it\\u2019s tough for me to *want* to spend time with people who\\u2019ve treated him so poorly, and he asks me to just tough it out. \\n\\nSaturday (1/26), I woke up feeling somewhat alive, but still very hacky, sore throat, tired body, but I thought I could at least make it for a couple small things with them, so we took them to our fave local Chinese restaurant, then we went to a couple Goodwills nearby, where we found some items for my husband\\u2019s grandma, and other items, too. I needed to go to Walgreens for further meds and a photo pickup, and the in-laws were to follow, as they needed something. My BIL & fianc\\u00e9 did not come on this outing, as he was working and she had a food tasting class (even though this visit has been on the schedule for like 6wks). They randomly disappear on the way to Walgreens and we\\u2019re left sitting there texting MIL to figure out wtf is going on and where we\\u2019re going. \\nNote: I am a person who does *not* do well without plans when there\\u2019s a group of people involved. So this sudden divergence from the plan *slightly* stresses me out, plus I\\u2019m overdue for my inhaler and having trouble breathing, so I snapped at my husband about their inability to maintain a simple plan and then not pickup the phone when he calls to see what\\u2019s up, forcing us to do everything via text (which she needlessly interjects unrelated memes into, thus taking her longer to reply). My husband agrees we should go ahead and go home so I can take meds. I *did* apologize for snapping at him once I got the meds and was less stressed about the state of my breathing. By the time we got home, though, I was honestly exhausted by the small outings and was again stressed about the possibility of being expected to do more that night. \\n\\nAn hour or so later, we get a text that they\\u2019re at a local cafe that has vegan pies. I had *repeatedly* offered (both in person and via text) to cook a large family meal for *all* of us this particular evening, in an effort to not have to go out, but the MIL and BIL never gave me an answer on this, so hearing that they were just randomly out getting pie was surprising. Still, vegan pies!?!? I was excited and it is *very* close, so we went. There was a single vegan thing on the menu, and it wasn\\u2019t pie. So we\\u2019re sitting in this crazy busy restaurant, 5 of us (because fianc\\u00e9 is tired from her food tasting class and didn\\u2019t come), taking up a table so my BIL can eat the veggie burger and my FIL can eat a BLT while the rest of us sip piss poor tea (a sin in Texas). The whole time we\\u2019re there, the BIL is talking about what to do that night. He starts suggesting various bars, including a piano bar, all of which vary from 15min away to back downtown again like last night (35min plus tolls). My in-laws don\\u2019t drink at all, I drink rarely (but even now can\\u2019t due to antibiotics), and same for my husband. But the BIL keeps pushing things that are primarily booze focused. I\\u2019m starting to feel like even though he has repeatedly asked us what we all should do that he actually has all the things planned and is just trying to steer the convo to his end goal/destination/plan. I say I\\u2019m pretty tired, but maybe if we all round up back at our house, we can ask my roommate where we should go, as he goes out regularly and would surely have the best recommendations. Finally, my BIL concedes we should come back to our house. Unfortunately my roommate had gone out unexpectedly, so we couldn\\u2019t ask him where to go, plus, it had started raining a good amount. After showing him to the alcohol hutch and inviting him to partake as he wished, my BIL agreed we could and should stay in and play a game here. I convinced my in-laws to play Cards Against Humanity, which was crazy and insane but actually fun (seriously, these two senior aged conservatives played some *savage* combos!). I made some oven baked from the freezer vegan snacks for everyone a few hours later and we kept playing til about midnight or so, when I was so tired and hacky that I had to excuse myself to sleep. My in-laws were understanding and thanked me for hosting even though I was sick. It really *did* turn out to be a pleasant evening, which was surprising but welcome. My BIL stayed til almost 4a because he\\u2019d had *so much* to drink and needed to sober up, but he was able to sort of reconnect with my husband for the first time in a while. Cool.\\n\\nSunday (1/27), my husband gets a text inviting us to brunch at a local well known small chain diner. This is the *only* thing we\\u2019re told we\\u2019re doing, so I choose to go, thinking we\\u2019ll come back here after and then regroup for any additional activities OR that my husband will ride with my BIL (whose fianc\\u00e9 is again not there but no reason given this time) if they choose to leave from there. It\\u2019s worth mentioning that we share a vehicle, so we *had* to drive there together. During brunch, my BIL says, \\u2018Let\\u2019s go to Mt. Insertaname after this!\\u2019 He\\u2019s mentioned it a couple times already over the weekend, and even though I\\u2019ve lived here nearly a year, I\\u2019d never been. The Mount is a well known scenic overlook for several areas of the city and very touristy (not that the in-laws are new to the city, they\\u2019ve been here *many* times). I agree to this **one** thing while we\\u2019re eating, because I feel a little better (but nowhere near normal, still very hacky, sore throat but not as bad, and my breathing is still fucked), plus there\\u2019s a Trader Joe\\u2019s on the way home and I wanted to get a couple staples while near, since I don\\u2019t get out there much. So we pay and head out front to regroup after everyone uses the restroom, as my BIL mentions he doesn\\u2019t know if Mt. Insertaname has restrooms. We\\u2019re just about to go to our respective vehicles when my BIL mentions that he\\u2019s riding with my in-laws but he\\u2019ll just ride back with us later today. No asking, just telling us that\\u2019s what he\\u2019ll do. I go along with it, because he really *is* shockingly close to us. So we\\u2019re off on our *one* outing that I\\u2019ve agreed to. \\n\\nNow, my BIL is *well aware* of my existing physical issues (total hip replacement, multiple surgeries on both hips, chronic pain that\\u2019s so bad I\\u2019m medicated with opiates as needed...I can walk, but, like, there are certain things any reasonable person would think mention to a semi cripple like me...you\\u2019ll see what I mean), and his own mother has existing issues as well and is not in *great* physical health. His father is also nearly 70 and has his own problems. I\\u2019ll remind you, I\\u2019ve never been to Mt. Insertaname before. My husband and I pull up and are waiting for them for 10 more minutes (because they\\u2019re *always* late, even though we left at the same time). I\\u2019ve not noticed anything concerning about the landscape of Mt. Insertaname at this point, so I\\u2019m excited to check it out. We get a BIL call who says they\\u2019re there and to come meet them at the steps. *The steps. The 100+ stone, not terribly even, pretty steep steps.* I actually did ok getting up them but was very out of breath and wheezy when done, and my hip was smarting, but my in-laws each needed one of the boys to help them up and required several stops to rest. And the BIL *never* mentioned these steps before we agreed to go there. The whole overlook is very rocky and dangerous for older people on their feet, and there\\u2019s a good amount of walking to be done when you get to the top. Again, the boys had to help the parents because of the landscape and their health. I pressed on. I quietly express my disbelief to my husband that BIL thoughtlessly brought 1 sick cripple and 2 old people here, and he reminds me to tough it out.\\n\\nWe made it back to our vehicles and a parent has to use the restroom, so we go to a nearby grocers, where husband and I stay in our car. This restroom visit turns into *25min(!)* of them in the grocers looking for drinks and milling around like they don\\u2019t have XYZ Grocers in their city (they do). The BIL tells us on his way in to find something to do after this. I suggest the tea room and he rejects it out of hand, even though I say his mother was enthusiastically interested in it when I told her about it. Plus, it\\u2019d be an easy thing to do for a group of people who\\u2019ve been worn out just now. Again, he rejects it. When they come back out they don\\u2019t stop at our vehicle, they just get in theirs and the BIL starts going to the next stop that he hasn\\u2019t even run past us to see if we\\u2019re in or not. I\\u2019m getting very frustrated at this point because of how long they\\u2019ve just been pissing around in the store while we\\u2019re here just killing time, combined with the insistence that we now must go to a 2nd touristy outing *and* that his brother is just flat out rejecting this thing I\\u2019ve suggested that I *know* my MIL will love. My husband gets irritated at my irritation and asks what I\\u2019d be doing if I wasn\\u2019t here. I tell him it\\u2019s the first day I\\u2019ve felt mildly human in a week, and I\\u2019ve got a dishwasher to unload and reload because evidently if I don\\u2019t do them, the boys won\\u2019t do shit with the dishes (two roommates and him) and will just pile and pile til I\\u2019m better. I also mention that I need to clean the fridge out because of all the (unsolicited) food the mother has brought that\\u2019s more or less crammed. And, above all else, I\\u2019d be in pjs, comfy house shoes, and even if I did none of that, at least I\\u2019d be at home and comfy. Again he\\u2019s irritated with my irritation and asks me to tough it out. I tell him the next thing *has* to be the last thing. Finally around this moment the BIL in the other vehicle thinks he should call us and tell us where he\\u2019s taking them...to the Botanical Gardens\\u2014another walking/hiking outing, even though the parents have both complained about their hips and backs after Mt. Insertaname!\\n\\nWe arrive at the Botanical Gardens and I have the opportunity to speak to my BIL privately while my husband is waiting to help his parents along. I cordially but firmly tell him that this *has* to be the last outing, because I can barely walk, I\\u2019m having trouble breathing again, and I\\u2019m exhausted. I also mention that, in the future, my husband will need to take a separate car (we\\u2019re buying one in the next week or two) or ride with him if he (BIL) insists on regularly tagging things on to an outing or working without a plan for the group, because I don\\u2019t do the no plan thing. He chuckles and says he understands. \\n\\nWe walk through the gardens for maybe 45min; they\\u2019re also very steep and include very rocky and uneven paths. My husband and I have a very brief (3min or so) moment together that I enjoyed (we found a hidden path that we explored together), but I tell him again that I just *cannot* go on after this. I say it near the BIL & in-laws. It\\u2019s at this point that my MIL asks if we should wrap it up after this or if the vegan milkshake place is close, coz she\\u2019ll pay for one for all of us. I *again* say I am totally exhausted and in pain. My BIL pipes up and says it\\u2019s not far, we\\u2019ll go there!, and my husband very weakly interjects that I\\u2019m (me) really done for, but he\\u2019s overrun by his brother, so my MIL says, \\u2018well she can just stay in the car and you (husband) can just tell her what\\u2019s on the menu and bring hers back to her!\\u2019 I\\u2019ve been doing really well tolerating them this whooooolllle weekend, but this flippant, totally inconsiderate comment with complete disregard to me enrages me. I excuse myself to the restroom, where I text my husband that I am so miserable that I can\\u2019t go on and am considering just ubering home for $41 (I\\u2019m a huge cheapskate in this regard, like I *never* use Uber/Lyft, so this should have been a big flag that I\\u2019m not joking about my misery). He \\u2018lol\\u2019s back to me, and I tell him I\\u2019m glad he\\u2019s laughing at my misery, because it\\u2019s all I have in me to keep the tears back at this point. He doesn\\u2019t respond and I collected myself to come back out. He again says to tough it out, and I just *lose it* at this point, which is just *so* rare for me. I snapped at him that I\\u2019ve had it, please just take the car keys and let me Uber home, I can\\u2019t take (BIL\\u2019s) constant adding on, and I\\u2019m just stuck here because if I take the car then there\\u2019s no one to take the BIL home since he just *told* us he\\u2019d be riding home with us. The BIL and in laws likely heard this part, even though I\\u2019m trying to keep it quiet or at the very least I\\u2019m definitely not yelling and just speaking in my regular voice. They went on to the car and left for the vegan milkshake place and husband is asking me why I\\u2019m so angry. I tell him *because I\\u2019m in fucking pain, I can\\u2019t breathe, my nose is running, your inconsiderate jackass brother keeps taking us on physical outings and just adding one more thing, and now we\\u2019re trapped here coz that asshole needs a ride home!* I was probably closer to yelling in the car at this point, though loud speaking would probably be more accurate, if for no other reason than my sore throat. I\\u2019m also full on ugly crying, which is making my breathing even worse. I ended up sitting in the car while they got their shakes, and my in-laws left for home without even saying goodbye after that. My BIL came to get in our car with my husband, which required us cleaning out/cramming stuff from the backseat into the hatch area, because we had the backseat packed with things that go to my parents when I see them next, which was just another inconvenience that was put on us by the BIL just *telling* us we\\u2019d take him home that day. \\n\\nWhen we drop BIL off and finally see just how close we\\u2019ve been living this whole time, it\\u2019s mentioned that fianc\\u00e9 isn\\u2019t there because she\\u2019s at the store. I mention to my husband that the only redeeming quality of the BIL is that apparently he doesn\\u2019t force his fianc\\u00e9 to just \\u2018tough it out\\u2019 with the in-laws whether she\\u2019s sick or not. \\n\\nI honestly don\\u2019t know if I should feel bad (more bad...worse?) about the way I finally snapped. AITA here?\\n\\nTL;DR:\\nAbusive in-laws come to town this weekend to visit us & BIL & fianc\\u00e9. I am recovering from hellacious bronchitis but still sick. They were told how sick I was and that I might not be able to do much with them. Husband repeatedly tells me to tough it out. BIL asks for input what to do during visit but is suspected to have had his own plans for weekend the whole time. BIL takes a cripple and 2 old people on very physically demanding and exhausting outings after only asking us out for brunch, then tells us we will drive him home. Husband tells me to tough it out again. I lose it on husband after 2nd physically demanding outing.\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"This probably happened about a month ago.\\n\\nI am a 17 year old male working minimum wage at a fast food place. About a month ago I had a severe pain coming from my lower back on both sides of my body. I am not very physically fit. Probably 210 Lbs and 6ft with - i admit- a poor diet that has soda involved. My mind instantly went to some form of kidney failure or other serious problem.\\n\\nNormally I would tough them out. The pain wasn\\u2019t crippling. However, they lasted for well over 4 hours.\\n\\nNearing the fourth hour was when I decided I should go to the hospital. Before I did, however, I called my father. I wanted to make sure it was ok with him. I am old enough to know the hospital is expensive and I didn\\u2019t know if we had enough money to pay for it. We are middle class, maybe middle upper but both of my parents have debt from school. I didn\\u2019t want to add on if the bill was going to be astronomical.\\n\\nSo I called my father to make sure it was ok to go. He answered even though it was so late because he was taking care of my infant brother since he had woken up in the middle of the night. I told him the situation and he was rather indifferent if I went to the hospital or not.\\n\\nI went, found out I had an infection in my kidneys and they sent me home with a prescription for some medicine.\\n\\nNow this part of the story happened tonight. I had just got off of work and my father told me that the bill for the trip had come. Both my father and my stepmother have been talking about the bill for the past month. About how it\\u2019s going to be expensive and how they both feel it was unnecessary to go to the hospital. It made me feel guilty because i didn\\u2019t want them to have to pay for something so expensive because of me. This is where my father had now informed me that the cost of the bill was going to roughly cost $2100.\\n\\nHe also informed me that I had to pay it.\\n\\nI was taken aback. While I fully understand my parents aren\\u2019t rich, neither am I. I have $1450 saved for a car (per my parents request) that i save money to buy one. I make roughly $200 a check and put $150 of it away each check.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the question\\nAITA For feeling like I shouldn\\u2019t be the one paying this check? Or should I feel like I should pay it?\",\n",

The other day she was talking to me and discussed how she wanted to convert to Buddhism and accordingly adopt its practices, including meditation, and I was concerned and told her that meditation is usually only practicable by low IQ individuals as high IQ minds require constant enrichment and are always seeking new ways to apply themselves and therefore cannot be satisfied sitting idly for prolonged periods focusing on literally nothing, but warned that, like drug use, mediation can be appealing to high IQ people by causing momentary stress relief (usually) at the cost of their IQ, leaving practitioners permanently crippled intellectually without the ability to apply themselves in ways that even those with average IQs can. My cousin became very upset when I said this - apparently taking it as a personal insult because she is interested in mediation - and did not calm down when I explained that I was only concerned for her wellbeing.\",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"Background: My mom passed away 5 years ago. It was extremely hard on the family...to no surprise probably hit my dad the hardest. He spent the next couple years depressed. Then he met a woman, let's call her Sally. Sally is an interesting character. She's had two prior marriages which both ended in unfortunate circumstances (both husbands are deceased from natural causes). She tends to be very controlling, manipulative, and is overly sensitive. Me and my two siblings have given her a chance, but it gets harder each time one of these incidents comes up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe situation: My wife and I got married this past year. We had a month of coordinator and a photographer. Sally was there with my dad, obviously. She helped us out with a few things here and there, mostly suggestions. My wife essentially planned the whole wedding otherwise. Anyway, afterwards, Sally asks us if she can use our wedding photos for own event planning business she was starting. No problem, we said, thinking she would use pictures of our wedding that included the stuff she loaned us or made suggestions on.\\n\\nWell, she put up pictures of virtually everything other than what she worked on. This was on a website, her facebook, and instagram. We didn't really know the extent of it because we didn't really look...but hashtags like #weddingcoordinator were used in each picture. Our actual wedding coordinator apparently found this, and made her OWN post using a picture of me and my wife from the wedding and slamming Sally. She did not mention Sally by name nor me and my wife, but the post was scathing and detailed how stealing someone's work was not okay and it was \\\"filthy\\\". Basically, she thought Sally was claiming to coordinate our wedding when she hadn't.\\n\\nMy wife and I were floored by this and we e-mailed our coordinator that it was unprofessional and she needed to take the post down. She did within minutes and apologized. Why she didn't e-mail or call us first I don't know. She claims she enraged that we knew about this (we didn't) and that she worked hard for our wedding (she didn't). \\n\\nAfter this, we get on the phone with my dad and Sally. After a lot of humming and hawing, Sally appeared to agree to take down the pictures. My dad got defensive of her and suggested that she did more for our wedding than our actual coordinator. Sally also told us she never once claimed to have coordinated our wedding. I could tell Sally did not like the idea of taking the photos down, and when we said goodbye she gave us a quiet \\\"bye\\\" like she was upset.  Later that night I told my dad that our actual coordinator took down the post, and he asked if that meant Sally could keep the pictures up. I said no, they need to be taken down. It's been over 24 hours and they're still up. My dad says he wants to talk to me at lunch tomorrow.\\n\\nAITA? I can't be...right?\",\n",

(TLDR is at the bottom)\\n\\n               Before, During, and a little while after the time of my birth, my mom was a drug addict. From 0-2 yrs old, I suffered from neglect. (She would leave for hours at a time, and whenever I cried I would be given candy to shut up(I had to get QUITE a few fillings))\\n\\n              When I was 2 my mom went missing (turns out she was partying and then crashed @ a friend\\u2019s place) and my aunt found me at home, alone. Due to my father not being in a financially stable enough situation, I ended up living with my G-ma. After a couple months, my mom was forced to give up her rights as a parent.\\n\\n             After this, she has done EVERYTHING possible to improve as a mother and overall person.\\nCurrently, she is a college graduate and has a husband whom she shares a daughter (my half-sister) with. \\nMy mom, along with my Aunt and G-ma want me to try and \\u201creconnect\\u201d with her. Since I hate to look rude, I accept to hang out with her. \\n\\n            It\\u2019s...uncomfortable, to say the least.

It seems that she GENUINELY wants to connect with me, but I just can\\u2019t seem to get over our history and her current vibe with her husband, so I\\u2019ve been making excuses NOT to see her, or at least kindly turn her down. \\n\\n             Since I\\u2019m moving to Tennessee over the summer, I\\u2019m thinking of using it as a way for both of us to cut our losses, since all of our interactions have been strained.\\n\\nTLDR: My mom abandoned me and is now trying to reconnect, I try to turn her down as much as possible\\n                                                   \\n                                                  Am I the asshole?

      "        \"selftext\": \"Okay so I feel like I just fucked up really badly especially with someones life being at stake here but I also am unsure because my intentions were pure.\\n\\nOkay so one of my best friends who has recently gone though a really rough breakup and is having issues with his family, recently told me that he wanted to end my life. Having been suicidal in my past, I told him that it wasnt worth it and everything gets better and he needs to stay strong (which is clich\\u00e9 but it seemed to help him a bit)\\n\\nAfter that, almost everyday he was saying he wasnt feeling good and was in a bad place to which I told him that I and a lot of other people love him and he needs to hold on and stay strong.\\n\\nTonight was different though. He told me he couldn't do it anymore and he was ready to end it. This is how the conversation roughly went:\\n\\nFriend: \\\"I wanna do it now, I wanna let go\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"it's not worth it. You don't need to do this\\\"\\n\\nF: \\\"I'm losing everyone who is important to me constantly and its always on bad terms\\\"\\n\\nM: \\\"What you're considering isn't going to fix that problem\\\"\\n\\nF: \\\"It will kill the problem though, it'll be over\\\"\\n\\nOkay so this is where I'm going to start directly quoting what both me and my friend said to each other with sight changes to names and other personal information to avoid any bias. This is where I feel that I fucked up:\\n\\nM: \\\"One of the most important people in your mum, dads, sister, step dads and my life is you. You talk about how you lose the most important people on shitty terms but at least those people are still walking. The shittiest term is someone who is in your family leaving for good. I'm sorry if I'm coming off as harsh but you need to hear this stuff because just telling you that \\\"it'll get better\\\" ain't gonna change how you think.\\\"\\n\\nF: \\\"Sam, Fuck off. You dont have a clue what my family go through, what they have gone through. Tell me again about family leaving and i'll kill you\\\"\\n\\nSo I can see that he thought I meant that his family would leave him because I said \\\"The shittiest term is someone in your family leaving for good.\\\" By which I actually meant that thats what his family would go though if he left and not any of his family members. Anyway, I went on to try to explain this:\\n\\nM: \\u201cNo [Friend], I'm not saying I know anything about what they go though and I'm not telling you about them leaving. I'm trying to tell you that they fucking care about you and you leaving would put them though more shit that I can tell they don't need. I'm trying to save your life man. Not ruin it\\\"\\n\\nF: \\u201cStop, just leave\\u201d\\n\\nI know he\\u2019s in a bad place and at the end I was clearly getting panicked and somewhat annoyed that I wasn\\u2019t helping but I don\\u2019t know if I was being an asshole or not. I care about the kid I just don\\u2019t really know what the right thing to say to him is I guess.\\n\\nTL;DR: My friend is considering suicide and I was trying to help him by telling him how he would make his friends and family feel if he did go though with it and I think I may have said the wrong thing but I\\u2019m not too sure\",\n",

After she was set to go, i made some plans to have a small weekend roadtrip to see some friends in my hometown. Her trip was canceled the day before she was supposed to leave, and we were both very happy about that. \\n\\nFast forward to now. This is the weekend i was supposed to go visit, and my wife has found out that she's leaving for a few weeks for a different unexpected work trip this monday. She really wanted to go out (which we have not been able to do for a while) and spend the weekend together before she leaves, but several of my old friends are already excited that I'm making a trip in, and one had planned a party, which he has already spent a decent amount of money on. \\n\\nI'd love to spend the weekend with my wife, but my closest friend has already gotten the weekend off, which as a cook/bartender  is hard for him to do, and spent well over $100 on a small party for me. \\n\\nI can tell my wife is dissapointed, though she understands, and i want to be here for her before she leaves, but i don't want to leave the people expecting me hanging out to dry either. I offered to take her out on a nice date tomorrow, as I'm leaving on Friday, to make up for it, but i still feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. \\n\\nAITA for not cancelling my trip?\\n\\n\\nEdit: she cannot come with me. She's in the navy and is not allowed to be a certain distance from her ship, and where I'm going is a fair bit outside of that. \",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"Hi, 18f here, i live in a heavily religious Christian family and I myself am leaning towards atheist myself. Now, I want to give all the information beforr I start, my dad is verbally abusive towards my mother. No, he has never laid a hand on her but he makes her feel like snot amd when they argue he always turns around the problems on her. He also ruined my 18th birthday and I went into crisis counseling the next day so just cry for an hour. (Spoiler, my councilor didn't really help).\\nJust a quick note he grew up in an physically abusive relationship with his patents where they taught him that spanking was not only okay, but the right thing to do. Yes, i consider it physical abuse because it still haunts me when he pulls off his belt and calls me over and it makes me extremely scared when he jokingly threatens hitting me and he loves to do it often. He also has a tendency to snap at me about the littlest thing, like one day I said didn't want dinner because I wasn't hungry it was like 4 in the afternoon and two hours later my mom made a potato and i grabbed a fork with the intention of taking a single bite and my dad lost his bleeding mind and yelled at me how I shouldnt eat because i said i wasn't hungry.\\n\\nSo yeah, i hate him. I could write a book on the absurd things he says and does and if anyone asks I would be happy to share because its kinda funny.\\n\\nBut, hes probably actually depressed, having worked at a well paying job for 14 years then quit it due to the toil in order to start an insurance business. Tbh i hated him for it but its just because my quality of life decreased and i myself stressed that we wouldnt be able to live in the house anymore. I asked my mom if we could get him a therapist and lo and behold he had one but refused to talk ab the important stuff???\\n\\nSo story begins. I made tea for the day and we drank it all by after dinner. He asks me to make more and I said multiple time, trying to get my words out as he laughed at me bc idk he thought it was funny that I said simply \\\"no, i have school tomorrow and i need to take a shower.\\\" If anything my lazy, racist brother was sitting at the table across from the kitchen just putting legos together like he wasn't a twenty year old man who still lives with his parents. So my dad lost it and called me down to piss and yell at me about how i had no power in the house and he could make me do whatever he wanted. Idk he screamed for another 10 minutes im just nodding and saying yes sir at this point because id rather hurry this up. He moves on and i turn my back to cry. I go upstairs and cry and my mom comes in to counsel me and i said i didn't want to talk to her, never did i raise my voice or swear. Shes also a snitch so there was no way i was saying anything, ive learned my lesson.\\n\\nI pass the master bedroom and she calls me in and tells me i have to be more humble to him, i have to grovel and say im sorry. Wow red alarms. I listen to that for like 5 minutes and its extremely uncomfortable because she talks about how hes the head of the house hold and smth religion related. I yeet out of there as fast as possible with no intention of saying any sort of apology. Should i apologize? Just so yall know this is definitely not the first time this has happened and will not be the last, but I always feel like its never been justified.\\n\\n This is genuine btw and im not just ranting because I really want to know if i should just accept it and do what my mom wants just a bit longer because I know he's going through a very stressful part of his life or hold to my own \\\"hard hearted\\\" beliefs.\",\n",

I was also planning on visiting her at our school that I left but clearly I won't be doing that if I take a break.\\n\\nIt feels like a really shitty thing to do because she already often doesn't enjoy her birthday, and this is possibly the first year in a while that I could even see her in person on her birthday and I would be ruining that, but we're having another fight right now and it's literally been maybe two or three days since our last one, which was really nasty and painful. I think if I'm going to break it off and ask for time apart, I need to do it *soon* like tonight or tomorrow and bite the bullet while I have the courage. \\n\\nUPDATE: I did tell her, and it doesn't feel great, and I'm sure it hurt her, but you guys are right. I don't know if I have the strength to leave, but I can at least be strong enough to know when I should give myself breathing space and *do* that. Thanks for not only the judgement I've gotten and will get, but the insight given along *with* your opinions. \",\n",

      "        \"selftext\": \"My parents want me to tutor my sister but I know that would just be a waste of time. The kid isn't interested in learning and never listens to what she is told, I don't want to because I don't care nor do I have the patience. I am the oldest of 4  (ages 11,7,4) I tolerate them but I don't love them. My parents allow them to do whatever they please until they get annoyed. They are not good kids, really spoiled and entitled. The middle one (7 sister) is basically failing primary school. She doesn't have any responsibilities other than doing her school work: she has a laptop.  a tutor every Saturday for 1 to 2 hours, unlimited access to books, and programs for learning. She has everything she needs but isn't interested in learning, she'd rather play. I don't care about her education if she succeeds or fails it wont impact my life. My mother is being really manipulative. I am every name under the sun if I don't do what is asks of me and then I must forgive everything and act like there is no issue without an apology.\\n\\nWhen the first kid came I was almost 8 and I hated it but suck it up ( I hated being touched, hit and vomited on, also was ignored but that was for the best). I have always been expected to put their wants/needs over mine while ignoring all the issues they caused me if not I was selfish or whatever else my parents could think of. Honestly not bitter my mom doesn't like children and didn't want all of the stress that children cause, I was a young and independent kid that wanted approval from my parents so it makes sense. \\n\\nAnyway I'm just saying the kid isn't my problem, she doesn't want to learn and I don't want to to teach her. I even recommended to get the kid tested for some illness or something that was refused so then I explained that she would benefit from just planning to get a GED and going to trade school. School isn't for everyone so it is better to work at her level and stop holding people responsible for her.\\n\\nMy mom keeps telling me if she fails then I will have to help her but if that was the case she would be homeless. I am aware that isn't \\\"nice\\\" but she has no work ethic so sucks to suck.\\n\\nTLDR: I refuse to teach my younger sister (age 7) considering she has a lot of resources and is choosing not to progress.\",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI\\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for a few years and I know for a fact he\\u2019s not really an animal person, but I was glad that he still liked hanging out with me at home with my cats. I have three cats and they all hate him with a burning passion, it baffles me. He buys them treats and coos at them, but they just hiss at him and run away. We\\u2019ve been talking about marriage for awhile and he has dropped hints about proposing, which I was so excited for. \\n\\nA week ago, I had to go on a business trip and asked my boyfriend to stay at my house and look after my cats for me. This was the first time he would sleep over in my house without me. He said yes and I left completely at ease knowing my cats weren\\u2019t going to be alone. The evening after I left, I decided to check up on my cats. I had installed a baby camera for my cats so I can see what they\\u2019re doing when I\\u2019m at work and stuff. LO AND BEHOLD, I SEE MY BOYFRIEND HOLDING ONE OF MY CAT BY THE FUCKING TAIL. I was so confused, I didn\\u2019t understand what was going on. I decided to keep watching before calling him to ask what was happening and he proceeded to throw my cat to the side and walk away from the camera\\u2019s view. I called him immediately after that and asked him, as calm as possible, how my cats were doing. He said they were \\u201cdoing great, babe\\u201d and \\u201cI think they\\u2019re warming up to me now\\u201d. So I asked to videocall and he said okay, let him just get out of the bathroom. I looked at the camera and saw him letting one of my cats out of the closet (HE FUCKING LOCKED HIM UP) and the other one he tried grabbing under the couch. I had seen enough and couldn\\u2019t stomach talking to him anymore so I told him I\\u2019ll just call him tomorrow. I didn\\u2019t call. I went straight home after our final meeting, hoping I could catch him in the act. I arrived around 11-ish in the night and told him to leave. He was probably sleeping already and was so confused but I just calmly told him to leave or things will get ugly. He told me he didn\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s gotten into me and that we\\u2019ll talk tomorrow. \\n\\nI decided to check the recordings on my baby cameras, but sadly, they only saved 30 days worth of recordings, BUT IT WAS ENOUGH. He had been over a total of 16 times that month and out of those 16 visits, he had maltreated my cats 9 times. He liked to kick them when I wasn\\u2019t in the room and throw pillows at them. The tipping point was when I was sleeping and he had gone to the living room, took one of my blankets, captured one of the cats, and swung him around. I cried so much because I couldn\\u2019t believe he would do something like that. He had always pretended to be so sweet to my cats, but it was all an act. We were dating for THREE YEARS. God knows what else he had done to them before. I did not speak to him for two days or so, before finally gathering up the courage to face him. I broke up with him. I told him I knew what he had done to my cats and I cannot forgive him for it. Everytime I see his face it just reminds me of how badly he treated my cats, I JUST COULDN\\u2019T TAKE IT. I demanded he leave and never show his face again. Later that day, I got a call from my parents asking why I had broken up with my boyfriend. It turns out they had been planning his proposal with him and they are absolutely brokenhearted that he had called to inform them there wasn\\u2019t going to be any proposal because I had broken up with him. What was worst is that I called it off because of my cats. I ended the call and refused to speak with them. I received a bunch of messages in the next few days from my family and friends telling me to get back with my boyfriend and that it was stupid of me to choose a bunch of animals over a person who loved me and supported me and who I could actually build a life with. I could easily adopt another cat but my boyfriend was \\u201cirreplaceable\\u201d. My cats would give me nothing but extra mouths to feed and extra bills to pay. I deactivated my social media and stopped checking my messages aside from work. \\n\\nI see their point. That I had a future with my boyfriend and we\\u2019ve been through so much together, bla bla bla. But he hurt my cats. MY CHILDREN. They were more than just \\u201canimals\\u201d to me. To think that they trusted me to care for them but all the while brought a monster who hurt them is devastating. I broke their trust. MY BOYFRIEND BROKE MY TRUST. \\n\\nEveryone I know is against my decision but I just wanted to hear it from complete strangers who don\\u2019t know my boyfriend and my relationship personally. Am I really the asshole for choosing my cats over my boyfriend? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\ntl;dr In a group project, friend doesn't do his part so I have to do it for him during a meeting. He shows up to the meeting late, and does nothing. Later he tells me that when he saw me doing his part, it made him feel like \\\"the group is too big\\\" and that there wasn't anything for him to do so he has a mini panic attack, when in reality there were many tasks if he just would have asked. So I reply to him first acknowledging that I understand panic makes you freeze, however there are in fact many tasks and the group is not too big, but it was his job to ask what he could do to contribute. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay the title sounds bad but that is the most concise way to say it. Basically, friend A and I are in a group project together consisted of mostly friends. A was supposed to do work with his partner, we will call them B. This week we met up in person, and when my partner (we'll call her C) checked, we saw A and B didn't do their part. We thought hm, okay they were busy no big deal, we need it though so we'll start on it. We couldn't ask A or B to do it during the meeting because B was too busy to come, and A was running late, so C and I just decided to start it since we were finished with ours and needed to do their part before moving on. No one really seemed upset, we're all friends and pretty understanding people.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, A comes in, and sees C and I working on his part. I clarify with him \\\"Oh you couldn't get to it right? We needed it so we just started on it.\\\" Okay, here I feel bad because I didn't say \\\"oh you can contribute to it too\\\" but I figured our group leader would give him work. However, I noticed he is just sitting there and never really asked for any work. He was on his computer so I thought, maybe he found something else to work on for the project. I was too busy anyways with my partner C. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, the meeting concludes, and C messages me saying felt the group was too big because he didn't have any work to do, so he panicked because he felt he wasn't contributing enough. Now, up until this point I wasn't upset with anyone, but this rubbed me the wrong way. We had to do his work that he was supposed to have finished, and sure, we are good on time, but we are still a long long way from finishing. We JUST started, so there was a plethora of tasks he could have done, OR he could have helped my partner and I.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I get anxiety makes you freeze so I'm not upset he didn't ask. I'm upset how he claims its because there wasn't any tasks to do. So I first tell him I understand he froze up, we're all human, no one was even mad he didn't do his part, yadda yadda, but then I mention that the group isn't \\\"too big\\\" and that there were many tasks to do if he had asked my partner and I if we needed help or pretty much anyone in the group. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI feel I could be an asshole because I did notice he was rather quiet and I could have asked if he wanted to help my partner and I, but another part of me feels like that isn't my job (and had NO idea he was panicking/frozen). I also feel like maybe if someone is telling me that they panicked, it may have not been the time to say my opinion of \\\"there were tasks you could have done,\\\" but his comment really rubbed me the wrong way so I'm not sure. Would love another perspective \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo we were both hanging out and have been talking for a bit. I love how the conversation just flows and he's really sweet. He's been having health issues and before any flirting he'd share all the gory details and we'd scour the internet for reasons why. He's been to the hospital lots of times for this specific problem and they told him his prostate gland is enlarged so he has to keep going back. \\n\\nAnyways, we were together recently and things started to get heated. For once in my life I felt in control and feeling adventurous enough to not be afraid in case things went further. We spent so much time cuddling and talking that I relaxed and got comfortable enough to let him shed some clothes.\\n\\nHe tried to finger me but because of my experience with FGM, nails or sharp things near my genitals freaks me out. So he stopped and kissed me instead. Now BECAUSE I was turned on, I had no problem with self lubrication. In one of our heated chats, he'd mentioned that he had some condoms ready just in case I felt for him what he felt for me. \\n\\n\\nNow here's the weird part. He was trying to start the sausage finds and gently stabs the pie hole game with his schlong uncovered. I told him no. He panicked and asked if I was ok. I told him to shut his mouth and bag it first cause I was ready for this. In zone. Prepared. Ready for a pounding. Just not with a bare weiner. \\n\\nHe was confused. I asked him if he had any condoms. He said he did. I asked if he wanted to go get them. He said they were in his jacket pocket. \\n\\nThis is when my mild headache began and my puss juices realized they weren't needed and I started to pack their bags and stop flooding my nether regions.     With my last experience where he thought the reason why married women gain weight is that they absorb the all that extra semen and the protein in them is equivalent to the calories you'd get from consuming a fully grown wolf.\\n\\nTo put it blunty, I was not about to go into an argument about why he should wear protection. If not for STD/pregnancy prevention, then it's because I don't want any of that nasty smelling discharge in my hooha until he got properly treated and cleared it. Oh and now would be a good time to add that his cum is yellowish stained. He's shown me in a vpicture after cumming on a tissue to gauge my reaction. I politely expressed my fascination and confusion and asked a thousand questions then recommended he get checked out at the hospital. This is how our conversations go. Nothing new. He doesn't get shy and I don't get easily grossed out by some things. \\n\\nBut when it comes to my body, I'm definitely self-aware. I do not want to fuck a stranger's wein that's not bagged. I do not want foul smelling discharge in my hooha, or yellow cum in me, or even the risk of pregnancy and STDs because I don't know where he has been before. From our talks it sounds like he's done some shady things for sex before. Bottom line I'm not comfortable. If I was peeing blood and had a whole list of alarming shit going on with my fuck stick, I'd want to bag it. If not to keep all that gunk in, but out of respect for the recipient. \\n\\n\\nThen had the nerve to get pissed. I was put off immediately and made up some excuse and he left. He says if I was really into him I'd have \\\"sacrificed\\\" and let him hit it. He says I'm mean to him. Am I the asshole? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We used my (and some of my mom's) airline points to fly mom and grandma into town for our baby shower. We ended up not heading down (5 hours drive) for brothers graduation (wife was 8 months pregnant) where whole family (my side) was present. We did travel down the previous weekend for her sisters baby shower. \\n\\nThe next bit is important, for context as it puts more importance upon every baby related event. Dad missed still born birth of first child, albeit I believe he was going to come down for a funeral service because he wanted to be there for that, which didn't end up happening. This is the one that really sets the undertone as my wife believes dad will fully missed, where as I believe it to be a miscommunication to our plans to remember. Doesn't help that we've never talked about it. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for not being annoyed, and conciquently not sticking up for my family, with my parents for not being able to make it to said birthday party? \",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nHi I just really wanted to get this off my chest. So this happened about 8 months ago. I guess I’ll start with background to the story. So I have a cat and her name is muffin. She is my best friend. I never had many friends and now that I’m high school I have absolutely zero. The only one who is really there for me is my cat. She runs to the front door every time when I come home, sleeps in my bed every night, and is just a really good friend. So this is where my problem begins. It’s finals week and all the teachers are cleaning out their rooms. I happen to be heading for my last science class of the year. As soon as I walk into the science room there’s a disgusting smell. It smells like frozen death. I thought nothing of it because the science rooms usually smell a bit off. I head to my seat which is in the back and I see people gathering around a cart in the corner of the room. I squeeze myself into the crowd to get a peek of what everyone is looking at. It’s cats. Dead cats. Frozen corpses left to thaw in the heat. It gets worse. Directly on top was one that looked exactly like her. I saw the lifeless body of my best friend. I couldn’t move. I was in shock. My eyes were tearing up immediately. I walked out of that room and went to the bathroom, where I spent the rest of the period crying. Eventually I left the stall and went to my moms office (she works there) to just calm down. After school I told her about what happened. And her response? It’s ok, they were strays. W h a t. You can’t be serious. MUFFIN WAS A STRAY. I was the only one who actually gave a crap. Then here’s the kicker. I got a detention for skipping class for and I quote “no reason”. I got a four hour detention for that. AITA for skipping??\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\\'m don\\'t remember every little detail, but I\\'ll try and remember as much as I can. I\\'m not going to try and put the person in a negative light because I don\\'t want to make this bias, which will be hard.\\nI think I was 13 and I used to take the bus to school. I was one of two girls on the bus and the others were boys. The girl, let\\'s call her Susie, usually sat in front of or beside me.\\nI don\\'t really know Susie, (she\\'s in the year below me) but she\\'s quite stand-offish (is that even a word?) and can be fairly rude. That\\'s all I know about her as a person really. Anyway, we I was minding my own buisness listening to music as I usually did on the bus and she was talking with the others.\\nThe bus driver stopped the bus at one of the stops to get off (this is because one of the boys on the bus was in the junior school and the bus driver had to make sure someone was there to pick the boy up or the bus driver had to walk the boy to his front door. The bus driver walked the boy to the door this time) and I was alone on the bus with the others.\\nI like sitting on my own and not talking to anyone on the bus at the end of the day because I get tiared from a lot of social interaction and can find it difficult. I struggle socially sometimes and don\\'t understand some social interactions or why some people do somethings. This is just how I am and have always been. I can\\'t help this.\\nI can\\'t remember what Susie said, but she went over to where I was sitting and took my phone out of my hands. I don\\'t like my stuff being randomly taken from me and makes me anxious when that happens.\\nThe next thing that happened was her threatening to throw my phone out of the bus, I didn\\'t know what to do in the moment, so I acted on impulse, punching her in the eye. I don\\'t think I punched hard, but even so, I still punched her and should\\'t\\'ve done that.\\nI did have her number and texted her over and over again saying I\\'m sorry and I regret what I did. I still regret it, but not as much now.\\nUsually the story would end there, and I would ask am I the asshole, but it doesn\\'t.\\nWhen it was the summer production, and we were both working behind the scenes, I still felt guilty and wanted to make up for it.\\nShe was the one who suggested she would slap me, which I see as fair (eye for an eye, which is something I believe). I agreed and said \"do it\" and she slapped me hard.\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nNote:\\nI was talking to one of the girls in her class, let\\'s call her AJ, and I remembered the story, so I asked AJ about what Susie said. AJ said that Susie told the story making me a evil person and her the victim. AJ also said that Susie still has a grudge against me.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My parents and fiance\\'s parents are paying for the majority it.  As far as my side of the family, we\\'ve agreed on:\\n\\n* Direct family, grandparents, aunts, uncles, first cousins, and serious SOs (spouses, fiances, long term BF/GF)\\n* My best friends from high school and college (and some goods friends that we\\'ve made since moving out)\\n* As far as my parents friends go, as long as they are a familiar face and we\\'ve have know them for a long time, I\\'m ok with it.\\n* No second cousins, young kids, or non-serious SOs (I have a cousin who has a new boyfriend every 6 months)\\n\\nMy dad is the type of person who likes having connections, and being a police officer for 25 years in a town of ~8000 people, he has a ton of them.  \\n\\nHe texts me yesterday saying that he and my mom have been invited to the wedding of some friends\\' kids and therefore feel like we should invite them to mine or risk hurting their relationship with them.  Knowing how he is with people connections and already thinking we have the guest list figured out, I\\'m naturally skeptical that these \"friends\" are some people I hardly know, like the principal at the school he\\'s worked at for a few years or some random people they went out to eat with once.  I ask who they are and say that I\\'d rather stick with people that we have history with rather than the old fashioned \"*Since I invited you to my kid\\'s wedding, you should invite me to your kid\\'s*\", which I don\\'t agree with.  I said that since it\\'s just 4 people who can replace people who likely can\\'t come, that it\\'s fine, but there should be a line for how many people we invite just because my parents happen to get invited to their kid\\'s wedding.\\n\\nAs it turns out, that the people are 2 good family friends that we\\'ve known for a long time but didn\\'t put on the initial guest list for some reason.  I was in band with one of the kids and played basketball with the other. So I say that it\\'s totally fine to invite them, but my dad is still upset because I\\'m don\\'t think the same way he does about who to invite and stuff.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to draw a line between good family friends and anyone who we\\'re just exchanging wedding invites with?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo yesterday was my girlfriends birthday, and as one is prone to do in college out west we went clubbing. We haven\\'t been hit by the cold snap so the clubs should be bumping and it should be a great night. We had about 30 people pregame at my house, and my GF was feeling good, like good spot to dance but nothing major. \\n\\nAnyway we get to the club and drinks are flowing and my girlfriend throws up from drinking. She\\'s only thrown up 3 times before in her life (from drinking) and I\\'ve seen her get pretty rocked. She\\'s pretty drunk and stumbling, tells me she doesn\\'t wanna drink anymore and gives me the drink the president of her sorority had just \\'bought\\' her. (We\\'ll get into that later) She was probably a lil gone but having a good time.\\n\\nAnyway next thing I know her president takes the drink out of my friends hand (I was trying to stay mostly sober so had given it to him) and surrounds my girlfriend with all her sorority sisters and eggs her on to drink despite her shaking her head no. Peer pressure is real and she\\'s taking sips of margaritas, vodka cranberry etc. I get it. It\\'s her birthday but there are very real limits to fun around alcohol. As someone who has had alcohol poisoning I dont wanna mess around with it at all. And I especially dont like it when \\'friends\\' essentially force you to drink. So this is where I step in and say \"you should stop drinking\" to my girlfriend pretty loudly and from behind her friends. \\n\\nHer president pulls me aside and asks what my problem is, and being upset I told her that she needs to quit buying my girlfriend drinks. Its loud, we\\'re packed together I have to yell at her to make her hear me and I accidentally knock her drink out of her hand. Whatever, I\\'ll pay for it. She\\'s pretty mad about that and my tone. We\\'re in a club I have to yell at you, and yeah I\\'m not happy. Her president says this isn\\'t her fault that my girlfriend is drinking so much. She says it\\'s her birthday, shes supposed to have a good time. (Drinking is a really good time until it isn\\'t, as anyone who has had alcohol poisoning will tell you). I think it is the presidents fault, and tell her that she shouldn\\'t be encouraging someone who is supposed to be her sister to drink to dangerous levels of excess. At the very least she shouldn\\'t be allowing others to do that. I tell her the next drink she orders she better order an ambulance with it and she gets in a huff and walks off.\\n\\nDuring the argument my girlfriend is carried out of the bathroom sobbing, with someone under each of her arms. She cant stand on her own anymore. I\\'m pretty heated at this point and just worried about my girlfriend, I try to walk up to her and they wont let me see her and want to leave without me. They say they\\'ll take care of her but in my mind they\\'re the ones who got her to this state. They say my arguing ruined her night and made her cry, and unable to stand on her own. I leave (2 minute walk to my house, 5 minutes to her dorm) and call her roommates. I let them know that she is super drunk and I will need to be signed in since her friends wont do it to let me help/see her.\\n\\nI get to her room and I can hear my GF scream crying from the girls bathroom. I want to help but not before her friends stop me and tell me they dont like me. I really dont care so I brush them off and walk in. Shes vomiting profusely over a toilet, unable to walk or even keep her head up. I grab her water and refuse to leave. The girls wanted to talk without me there and I said they could say whatever they needed to right then. So of course they threaten to call campus security. I mean yeah, it\\'s a girls bathroom but idgaf about that right now. One even said she wanted me to hit her so she could call the cops. My girlfriend is inconsolable and starts sobbing because she didnt want me to leave but I felt I had no choice. If my girlfriend was caught she would be kicked out of school and I was going to be arrested. Arrested because I wasnt going to leave the side of my girlfriend who I believed was dangerously close to alcohol poisoning. OK.\\n\\nSo I head back to my house to cool down and debrief with my roommates. I explain my side and they assure that I was doing the right thing. I get a call from her roommate saying I should come back because she is breaking down and wants me there.\\n\\nI zoom back to check on her. She\\'s on the floor, head in a trashcan, begging me not to leave again and I said I wouldnt. I made a side remark directed at her friends about how I would stay even if it got me arrested. Her friends take it personal and make me repeat it again, so I do. They of course, step out to call the police. I didnt really care at this point so I stayed. Best case scenario I go to detox tank, my girlfriend would get help, but then promptly kicked out of school. Her friends probably realized getting police involved would just hurt her more than me so didnt. We finally manage to get her into bed and I sat in a chair facing her while she slept until a fire alarm went off at 3 am. Her friend took her to her own room to look after her. She obviously wouldnt let me in so I went home and stayed up all night worrying and ran through 2 packs of cigs. Shes fine now but the situation had me seriously stressed. I haven\\'t slept or eaten and am just running on nicotine and emotions. \\n\\nKeep in mind that throughout this entire saga I was very straightforward with my concerns. And by straightforward I mean I dropped more than fair share of expletives because I was pretty upset. I went about it with no tact or concern for what people would think, I just cared my GF wouldnt die. I dont give a fuck if you\\'re a sorority president, dont be complacent while others force feed my girlfriend alchohol after she says no. And I dont care if you\\'re supposed to be her best friend if you\\'re the one shoving drinks in her face. Her friends think I\\'m an asshole but I refuse to apologize for putting someone\\'s wellbeing, especially someone that I care about, before her sisters ego\\'s and my own standing within that group. If they want to hate me because they failed to look after their own sister then so be it.\\n\\nTL;DR- GF\\'s \\'friends\\' threaten to call the police on me after I become upset they made her drink more than she should and I wouldnt leave her side\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': \"My wife and I are separated but I still live in the house for the next few weeks. Last night we agreed that she could go out as long as she came home before 6am so that I could take the car to work. We have two vehicles, a small car and a minivan. We also have five children. She watches the kids during the day Monday through Friday and I let her do whatever else she wants to do at night every night except for Monday and every other Saturday. This is just a temporary arrangement until I move out then we will be doing a 50-50 custody arrangement.\\n\\nAnyways.\\n\\nShe texts me at 545am this morning asking me if she could stay longer and if I could just take the van. I say no, she needs the van because it can hold all the children and has all the carseats. She says that she doesn't need the van or the carseats and that she wants to sleep in. I tell her that she might need them in the event of an emergency. She says that she doesn't care and that I need to take the van. We argue some more and then she says she has changed her mind and doesn't want to come home until 9 and then blocks my phone number. I end up being late for work since i'm trying to contact her and I don't want to take the van.\\n\\nI call her again at 9am and she says she has called the kids and told them to eat breakfast and then hangs up on me. At this point I don't know if she actually will be at home so I leave work and arrive at home at 930 and she is nowhere to be found. I text her, no response. She walks in the door at 10am and I tell her I would like to take the car back to work. She disagrees and starts yelling and cussing at me telling me she won't let me win and that I don't get whatever I want. I tell her all I have in mind is the best interests of the children in mind. She drives away while telling me to eat a bag of dicks and to go fuck myself over and over. I call her friend and ask her friend to just talk to her, that is all I say. She comes back at 11am and I take the car to work but screams at me until I drive away.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'To start off with i will say that this is not me in case, it\\'s my friend/classmate and i will apologise in advance for my broken english as it is my second language.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOk a bit of backstory, so we are 17/18 years old and at second grade of college/high school. there is this kind of a tradition to celebrate the third graders/seniors leaving the school that we celebrate it by hosting them a party and buying all the alcohol and food for them. and also there is another tradition going on about the same time now that the second graders have this oldish event in which we have a lot of old dances that we train and then there will be our big day to show off everyone how good of dancers we are.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo the thing is that we have also a party after our dance in the evening and usually people drink quite a lot in there and we have to pay for everything collectively beforehand. And now that we are planning both for the party of the seniors leaving and our party after the dances. we came to a conclusion that everyone should pay 20 euros so we can pay for both. And if you didn\\'t want to take part in our party after the dance you just wouldn\\'t pay 10 euros and not come to the party, And also if you didn\\'t want to pay for the seniors goodbye party then you just wouldnt be able to join next year when the current second graders would pay for you. quite simple.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo now we are at the point where everything is basically figured out and done. But my friend has strong beliefs against alcoholism and didn\\'t want to support the drinking or drink himself.  I of course assumed that he would just pay his part on everything else since the was a good planning for budget and all expenses were figured out so he just wouldn\\'t pay his part for the alcohol costs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere is  where is was really surprised that almost everyone started to scream to him that just pay the fucking 20euros and get this done with and don\\'t fuck around. he explained that he just felt that he wouldn\\'t like to part of supporting heavy drinking and just not pay for the alcohol and not drink it by himself now or the next year when we get the party. even after he gave a proper explanation  people still talked shit about him that \"always like this, never willing to co-operate\" which is partially true but in this matter I couldn\\'t really understand why he wouldn\\'t be able to just pay his part of the other costs like rent and food. And people kept telling him that just pay the fucking 20 euros and we can use it to buy foor and not alcohol so everyone will be happy, but as obviously terrible argument as that is because simply there would be more money to buy alcohol since someone else wouldn\\'t pay for the food and buy more alcohol which would still support heavy drinking.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI most often can relate to other views or atleast understand them but in this case i truly can\\'t understand why wouldn\\'t he be able to just pay his part in other costs so he would just be able to join the party and not dring because i was basically the only one that got his back. so is my friend truly an asshole?

TL;DR at bottom. \\n\\nNote: I\\'m new to Reddit, so if this doesn\\'t really belong here do let me know and I\\'ll delete it myself. Also let me know if I\\'m swaying things to much to be on my side, I\\'m trying to be as neutral in this post as possible. \\n\\nBackstory: my friend, let\\'s call him G, got into a serious fight with \"B\" and her friends. To avoid pandering to my friend\\'s side, I won\\'t give the details of this argument. But it pissed him off a lot. \\n\\nA bit latter G gets the memo from some other user that B was claiming that he  had sent her and her friends death threats. This caused him to freak out, and because B and her friends blocked G on every account they had, G asked me to talk to B about it for him. \\n\\nI oblige and shoot B a message. I\\'ll admit, I was a bit... Harsh in it. But what I said boils down to this: Why are you claiming my friend did this, and what proof she has of this.\\n\\nB claims she doesn\\'t actually think G sent the messages, just that the timing of them was a bit suspicious. Alright, fair... But why say he did in fact do it when you\\'re not even sure? Anyways, B then says to message one of her friends (J) for more info because she was done talking about it.... Then ends if off by telling me to \"leave me and my friends alone!\" \\n\\nNot knowing if she wanted me to contact J or not due to the contradicting statements, I decide to message J anyways. Again, I\\'ll admit, I was harsh. But not as harsh as I was to B. This time, the question was focused more on if they\\'re not sure G did it, then why tell people that G has? \\n\\nJ responded... Not as well as B. Gave me 0 answers, and told me to \"piss off\". I guess they and B told a bunch of people I had messaged them, because then everyone in that group blocked me. \\n\\nAfter that whole showdown, the feud between G and B grew worse. \\n\\nTL;DR - friend gets in fight with someone, and that someone starts telling people that friend sent them death threats. Getting in contact with that person and their friend (while admitingly being a bit harsh about it) results in their feud getting worse. \\n\\nP.S. - I know someone will ask, so I\\'ll make it clear here - due to the nature of their argument, I will not be providing details on it. I feel as if it may sway opinions too far one way or the other. Plus this post is about me getting info from B and J, not my friends fight with B. ',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI’m 18 and live in Phoenix AZ. I work primarily retail at a mall near me, and have been at different stores seasonally since 2016. During october and november, most retail stores go on a hiring spree for people to be trained by black friday. Hours are usually given mostly to those who have worked there already, so I planned on having two jobs to make some merry crimmis cash. In october, “ShoesInc.” gave me the choice between a seasonal position as a stockroom associate, or floor associate. I thought this would be a great opportunity for a new skillset, so I might as well just learn to do stockroom for the experience. I work about 4-5 days a week now at “ShoesInc.,” which i really enjoy. It’s my exact taste in store atmosphere, and I really enjoy it. \\n\\nMy friend then tells me how she works at “Huh?”, and they are looking for some associates to work the week of black friday, and a week before and after if possible. “Huh?” is a big clothing store, and is part of the same mall I work at. I miss this friend and we haven’t gotten to talk a lot, and she was good (and liked) at her job, so I decided no harm in making some extra cash. I go into “Huh?” after my shift at “ShoesInc.”, and meet the Ast. Manager. She’s a petite girl maybe 19 or 20. We chat about my experience and she gets to know me a bit. After chatting against the watch display case for like 20 minutes she goes “Yeah so you seem nice so i’m gonna tell the manager we should hire you. What’s your name again?” \\n\\nSo I get hired, complete everything online for onboarding EXCEPT for direct deposit. Which I get a paper from my bank and give it to them in person (something i’ve done everywhere i work). My manager schedules me for like 35 hours that week prior to black friday. I’m a jean folding god, and damnit I bust my ass in that store. It looked so nice when I worked, and I was really good work friends with some of the other associates i’d chat with. \\n\\nBlack friday goes by, and it was awful. I worked 11 hours from like 3am-11am then 12-3pm that same day. Worked insane length shifts that week. Someone pissed in a dressing room. Someone knocked over a mannequin. It’s whatever. \\n\\nTHE NEXT WEEK, my manager from “Huh?” comes into “ShoesInc.” during my shift holding her huge ass vape/mod in her hand, and i’m in the back doing inventory. She makes the assistant manager call me to the front of the store over the walkie-talkies, but she just says “someone is here for you up front.” Which is weird because 1. they knew my manager from “Huh?” and 2. My manager from “ShoesInc” has talked about how much she doesnt like “Huh?” bitch because she’s rude and stole her boyfriend or something. I walk out, see my manager from “Huh?” and she is LIVID. this lady is UPSET. she has an iPad in one hand and her vape in the other, physically flailing them around. She goes on some spree like: “YOU HAVEN’T FINISHED YOUR ONBOARDING FOR THE COMPANY YOU WILL NOT GET PAID IF YOU DONT FINISH THIS!! I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU HAVENT DONE IT YET IVE LITERALLY REMINDED YOU THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BE PAID!! YOURE DEFINITELY NOT STAYING ON PAST SEASONAL YOU MUST FINISH THIS I CANT BELIEVE THIS HA HA!” This is all happening while i’m on the clock at “ShoesInc.” while customers are watching this go down. My managers (2 assistants) are watching this go down. My managers didn’t intervene, and when I go back to the stockroom, they come up and go “Omg dude i’m sooo sorry we didn’t know that was herrrr omg. are u ok?? like for real omg im sooo sorrry” I wasn’t too upset, I mean I really didnt know what was wrong. I did the onboarding stuff, gave a PHYSICAL copy of direct deposit TO MY MANAGER And then I realized what was wrong. \\n\\nMy manager (“Huh?”) had fucked up so badly and never made me give them my proof of residency/social security information at all. I’ve been working at “Huh?” without any information not even an associate ID number because they needed staff so bad. So now I have to give them that information. I don’t want to though, and thats the reason i haven’t gotten paid. I don’t want to give my information to “Huh?” because i feel really weird about it now. Like it’s super super sketchy and they won’t talk to me. My manager at “Huh?” made me clean up piss off the floor so I’m not going in there alone without some company person being present. (Is that a thing?) The Huh? corporation is massive, but has only one number. I hadn’t been working there very long, so I never though about taking a picture of the HR numbers. I got someone from the main support line to get me a payroll extension but the lady just said “WHAT?? YOU DONT HAVE AN EMPLOYEE NUMBER?? U NEED ONE WHY DONT U HAVE ONE??” and refused to give me any numbers or extensions. Wait time for the main Huh? support line is 30 minutes EASY minimal. Waited up to 1hr30mins multiple times looking for help. \\n\\nTL;DR- Got hired because company needed black friday workers, never took information, reprimanded me at my OTHER seasonal job, i haven’t given them info because they have my direct deposit/other info online, so haven’t gotten paid\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I guess it wouldn’t be so bad if the nickname wasn’t associated with people being rude, mean, or obnoxious. But you never hear, “Did you see that guy that saved all those orphans from the burning building? What an asshole!” No one ever says at a funeral, “He was a beloved father, a loyal friend, and a true asshole.”\\n\\nNo. The term is always slung at someone who’s acting like a jerk. The rest of the digestive system has no sympathy for me. They give me shit all day. The esophagus is like, “Get ready to burn asshole because I just sent a bunch of jalapeños your way.” Then the stomach piles on by singing Ring of Fire (the Social Distortion version, not the original by Johnny Cash).\\n\\nThe other body parts are just as mean. The nose is constantly telling me I stink. And the mouth mocks me when I let some gas pass through. I’m a valuable member of the team! How would people like it if I just left and let the shit flow unhindered? Then they’d be sorry. And how great is it that you can go swimming and not have your anus fill up with water? Gee thanks, anal sphincter!\\n\\nI don’t know. Maybe I’m taking it too personal.  I’d just like a little more respect. What do you guys think?

She always complained that the expensive gifts of makeup that she got weren\\'t the right shade or sigh that, \"I didn\\'t get anything I wanted for Christmas.\"\\nMy sister also had a rule that if you were in her room she could do whatever she wanted to you, hence she would always smack me or pinch me and other shit like that (Id ask her kindly to stop, or playfully hit her back and she\\'d either tell me to leave if I didn\\'t like it or scream at me and we\\'d get in trouble.)\\nSo one day our mom our mom leaves us at home to go shopping because we didn\\'t want to go (she says she\\'s just getting bread, milk, and eggs but we all know that\\'s a fucking lie) and not ten minutes later my sister is pinching me and talking shit  about my friends. I was probably 15-16 at the time, she was probably 16-17. We both played soccer but she was 5\\'3 99 pounds, I was 5\\'6 116 pounds(I got my dads genes I guess) \\nI always told her that she was small and that someone was going to beat the shit out of her one day if she didn\\'t stop being a bitch. I just didn\\'t know it was going to be me.\\nSo I tell her to stfu. (She does not) \\nI end up snapping and slapping her across the face, and she screeches and grabs my hair. I\\'m tender headed so I tell her to let the fuck go or ill hit her again. ( She says no) Im really angry at this point and start to choke her out. (Bitch still doesn\\'t let go) \\nWe end up standing and I give her one more chance let go (A\\'s and B\\'s my ass this bitch is stupid)\\nSo I do what any rational person would do and slug her in the face. \\nThe she-rat screeches again and runs to the kitchen to call our mom. \\nMom get home ready to beat my ass and notices I\\'m missing a chunk of hair and my scalp is bleeding. Since I\\'m the youngest she screams at my sister. \\nAfter my mom forces us to apologize she asks us what we learn. Sister says she learned that I hit hard, I say I learned she has a strong grip.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then I was like ok? What did i do wrong then everyone in chat was laughing saying I saw that coming and etc. But before i said anything people were helping him out with the locations before hand so WTF? But anyway i reported him to twitch and went on to watch a different streamer that doesn\\'t treat people like shit for trying to help. So AITA in this situation?                   P.S. If there is any spelling errors i\\'m sorry i was kinda pissed off when trying this.    (EDIT): For the people who keep asking about rather he said no spoilers or not, There was no title or rule saying no Helping or spoiling plus i said that people were already helping him before i arrived in his stream and that\\'s why I helped him because he didn\\'t do anything to those people and if there was a rule i would of not done anything and we\\'ve not had any problems to start with. So in short people were already spoiling and he didn\\'t mind them, that\\'s why i thought it was fine.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I have enjoyed smoking marijuana in different amounts in different phases of my life - I experimented (once in a blue moon) with pot and some other halucinagens, as well as alcohol, all while in high school.  In college, I smoked semi-daily (like maybe 3-5days a week) and drank considerably more. Senior year of college I was working nearly full time while going to school so I binge drank less, but still regularly drank and still smoked daily (like, daily).  \\n\\nNow about 5 years out from graduation, I would say my smoking and drinking is similar to my senior year of college, but slightly declined.  I\\'ve recently been cutting back on alcohol, but its really for weight gain (beer). \\n\\nI was a solid student, missed homework assignments and compensated with high test scores, went on to play a college sport and get a STEM degree, like I mentioned worked nearly full time my senior year and had a solid job right away. \\n\\nI\\'m now debt free, my salary has steadily increased and I\\'ve moved my career in the direction I want it to go. I\\'ve expressed some displeasure with various work situations, and extreme dislike of particular employers, but I dont vent nearly as much as she does - I\\'m not complaining, it\\'s just how each of us are, she talks more about her work than I do about mine. \\n\\nOccasionally, usually when she is upset about something else already, she will complain about me smoking pot so frequently.  Another situation I\\'ve noticed is if I\\'m cutting back on alcohol (like now) or caffeine - she seems to see that I\\'m controlling my substance intake and decides it must be a good time to harp on pot again.  \\n\\nHer overall substance use is lower than mine, and always has been, but she has known me since high school (I even had something of a stoner reputation when we started dating). \\n\\nI am admittedly lazy sometimes, always have been since long before pot. But I\\'m generally on top of my shit. And -  She doesn\\'t complain that I\\'m lazy. No issues like being noticably stoned at inappropriate events.  I\\'m attentive, she often doesn\\'t know if I\\'m high or not.\\n\\nThat was the case tonight.  I came home and she was noticeably upset, nothing to do with me but she told me about it and I comforted her, she was calming down some and I\\'ve got my arm around her on the couch, I think we\\'re about to settle in and watch a show before bed.\\n\\nThen she notices my eyes are red, asks if I smoked, which I did and I said as much, and she got all huffy, got up to brush her teeth and remained more distant the rest of the night. No TV show.\\n\\nShe didnt say more than \"I wish you wouldn\\'t always do that\" but I can tell that she somehow feels that it invalidates the attention I gave to her issue a moment before.  Like, I listened, reflected back with her and helped her articulate her feelings, did my best to validate and support her.. but I was high while doing it so I\\'m an asshole? Like, am I? \\n\\nAm I an asshole for being high all the time, without causing issues by my being high?  Like, when I have tried to approach this topic with her she cant offer a reason why she doesn\\'t like it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**EDIT**\\n\\nHey so in my mobile editing of this post, i chopped off some important details - sorry, was trying to control the length of my post, but these bits folks have asked about do matter\\n\\n1. \"She\" is my wife, we\\'ve been dating 11 years (since HS) married for 1.  She smoked weed a few times before ever knowing me, smoked a few times with me in high school.  We went to different colleges, where she smoked occasionally with girlfriends, but like once or twice every few months, not frequently.  Since college shes probably smoked like 4 or 5 times over 5ish years, always with either me and her girlfriends (with me being the source), or just her girlfriends.  \\n\\n2. I smoke to get high, and I see it as \"medical\" in so far as it helps me deal with anxiety and insomnia.  But there is a buzz, I\\'m not trying to downplay that.  I do think some people who are less experienced with pot dont understand that your body adjusts to it a lot - like the first dozen times you get high, its almost like tripping acid or something, you can get goofy visuals (not cartoon characters, but looking at the back of a CD might be too much for you) - heavy smokers do not get that anymore.  It becomes much more like having half a beer, an hour ago.  It\\'s possible to be too stoned to have a human connection, but I dont think I\\'m there as, evidenced by my ability to handle difficult human situations like comforting an upset wife.\\n\\n3.  Rereading my own post, I realized there is another point I approached, but didnt fully flesh out.  I get the impression that my wife thinks I\\'m \"wasting my life\" and that pot is somehow holding me back, that\\'s why i mentioned our venting about work.  I sometimes get the impression that she thinks I would have left this company a long time ago if it\\'s so terrible, if only I wasnt a lazy pot head.  But its not terrible, I complain but everyone does - when my situation has become unbearable, I\\'ve made change happen - it just happens that those changes have kept me with the same company, who I still dont like on a high level.  But I\\'ve been rounding out my resume, transitioning from the STEM side to the bu$iness side, and increasing my salary - I\\'m not \"stuck\" there because I\\'m stoned and lazy, in \"stuck\" there because it\\'s what is best for my career right now.',\n",

But lets dive into the situation at hand. \\n\\nThis summer, my mom plans to send me back to our hometown where I can work at a relatives butcher shop and fly me back after I\\'m done.

Blah blah blah.. \"  \\n\\nSo AITA or are these feelings perfectly normal to want some time away from the people you\\'ve lives with forever pretty much?  Idk and would like an outside opinion.

       "  'selftext': 'Okay, this might be a bit long so fasten your seatbelts.\\n\\nI am a 20 yr old guy who is starting university this year. This is about an incident that happened approximately a month ago during work. I\\'m going to go to a university 400KM away and will not return for a while and wanted to get this mess out of my head. I apologize in advance for bad grammar, ranting, and lack or too much of info.\\n\\nI before being selected to university started an internship at a reputable bank in my country, and the branch I was assigned to just happened to be the second busiest one in the region and therefore despite interns usually being allowed to do only the simplest of tasks me and the other interns were provided the necessary authorizations to do most things a normal employee was able to do.\\n\\nI worked there for 9 hours on all weekdays and it was usually very late when I got home even more so because our branch operated for two extra hours compared to other branches. We were paid approximately 2.5$ a day as opposed to 250$ of a BT (Bank Trainee). The work environment was excellent. There were no harassment and the playful joke or two never went beyond acceptable.\\n\\nAfter 3 months of work, I was pretty much aware of how things worked and on a particularly busy day all our JEA (Junior executive assistants) of whom there were usually 2 had to leave early and I was the only one manning the counter. (Not the cash counter, we were at the service counter.) I was a bit restless because I had plans for that night and to not be late I wanted to catch the bus that left at 7.15 pm. So I was ready to run like the wind as soon as the bank closed at 7.00pm.\\n\\nThen at the last moment comes a man wanting a new ATM card. I pretty much rushed through it and in the hurry I forgot to take his ID with me when I took it to the officer in charge. He then proceeded to give me a lecture using not so nice words but nothing I haven\\'t heard before.\\n\\nOn a side note, the officer was a by the books prick. While I can understand there is a standard that is to be maintained in a bank when we write \\'Sign OK\\' nobody needs to check it and in cases of emergencies if the signature and the photograph match we *can* provide certain services without the ID... EXCEPT with this officer (I\\'ll call him Mr.A for ease.)\\n\\nAnyway, I was late and I went back got the ID and returned to another lecture in which he wasted further five minutes repeating the same thing. I  was pretty restless by now. Anyway, after I return The same customer says that he wants to apply for E-Banking and he wants it done now, with nothing to do I continue to do that and I was pretty much disappointed as I will surely be late if I had to do that, but well responsibility is responsibility so I got on with that.\\n\\nAnother thing I forgot to tell is my family is from a different region of the country and there are subtle differences in speech that I consciously suppress but sometimes slips out. One of them is that from where I am from we ask someone \"can\\'t you do .... ?\" instead of \"can you do .....? \" to imply respect.\\n\\nSo I again go to my officer armed with all necessary documents signatures and in my hurry, the words slip out of my mouth \"Can\\'t you please approve .... ?\"\\n\\nMr. A at that is f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*ing pissed and tears me a new one saying to show him respect and he worked on the bank from when before I was born... and the whole bank is looking at me. He gave me no chance to explain and sent me away telling me to find someone else to do it for me. I had to go to the manager and in the end, I was thirty minutes late to some personal business which is whole another can of worms that will not be opened today.\\n\\nI mean I was and am pretty pissed at this but that weekend me and a bunch of friends from school met and I told them about it. They made me realize why he might have been mad (I actually didn\\'t think from his shoes up to then) And from the next day I was extra polite to Mr. A, but f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* if he didn\\'t spit in my face at terminal velocity.\\n\\nNo reply to \"Good Morning\", No \"You are welcome\" to \\'Thank you\\'s and no looking at the face. And believe me, I kissed his ass for all it\\'s worth but nope, It was as if I was some kind of machine that existed to go through the motions.\\n\\nI mean, I was okay with it, we can do the mutually ignoring thing if that was to his liking and he *was* a very senior office after all. And if I did file a complaint what am I going to say \"this guy is ignoring me\"?\\n\\nAnyway, life goes on and mutual ignoring continues until finally one day I ask him to sign my attendance sheet (Inters as they only stayed for a very short amount of time marked their attendance on sheets and at the end of the month e-mailed it to compensation and benefits.)And he tells me to find someone else to sign it, while it\\'s clear that all the other \\'*someone else*\\'s are busy. And believes me I was as angry as I had ever been at the bank. Ignoring me is one thing but refusing what I am entitled is quite another.\\n\\nThis was around the time I got my letter of enrollment for the university that will start in the next month. I pretty much lied and said I had to resign within two days and today I did.\\n\\nAnd after all that I still feel angry and sad. Do I need to \\'man up\\'?\\n\\nAITA for all things above I had done? For resigning? For not clearing the air? For not being a bigger person?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit 1: Some typos and grammatical errors.\\n\\nINFO:  The designated work hours are from 8 am to 5 pm however seeing as the branch I worked in had unusual hours I worked from 9.30 am (Opening Time) to 6.30 pm except in situations as such. There is no contract regarding the employment except for the fact we will receive a letter of service after three months and a certificate after six months. \\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

       "  'link_flair_text': 'Not enough info',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'So the other day my wife and I were at a store at which I\\'ve previously observed far too many instances of long (>10 min) delays at the checkout stands, usually waiting for the supervisor/manager to come over to tend to an issue.\\n\\nAfter browsing the store we go to check out and naturally line up in whichever line we think will allow us to check out the fastest.  I\\'ve developed a habit now of lining up in one of the adjacent lines even if it is obviously longer and having my wife swing the cart over in front of me if I reach my cashier first due to issues with her lane\\'s cashier.  I always leave enough room between me and the customer in front of me so that noone else has to move their cart when she passes it over to me.\\n\\nI haven\\'t had any issues with this until the other day when the lady behind me noticed that I was talking to my wife and asked us to \"decide which lane we were going to be in.\"  I politely tell her that I think I\\'ll remain in my place in line and my wife will also remain in hers.  Lo and behold, my wife\\'s cashier has to call for manager approval so I take the cart, check out and roll out of the store while I hear the 4th request for the manager over the speakers.\\n\\nI was initially considering that IATA but I figure:\\n\\n-We\\'re only checking out once, we\\'re not adding a net amount of wait time to the population\\n\\n-In most cases, we don\\'t switch and there is no change to anybody\\'s wait time\\n\\n-In cases where we do switch, it actually spreads out the wait time (e.g. Suppose a cashier has a 10 min issue and it takes us 3 min to checkout our cart, if we don\\'t switch, everyone behind my wife gets a +10 min wait.  But if we do switch, everyone behind my wife only gets a +7 min wait while everyone behind me gets a +3 wait.)\\n\\nSo what say you reddit, AITA?\\n\\nEdit:  Yes, I agree looking at it from only the view point of someone in back of me is clearly a negative.  What I would like for people to consider is that it is a positive for people behind my wife.   If I\\'m still an asshole after all that then so be it.  But there are so many posts here looking at one single point of view.',\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nOkay so this is my first post so I hope I get it right. \\n\\nSome things I want to clarify first. Me and my then girlfriend (ex) had been together for about a year and a half at this point. I know this happened almost a year ago but I need to know for certain because it’s killing my mind. \\n\\nOkay so now the story, basically I promised her that I would take her out for a nice meal on a set date, so we talked it through and booked it about 2 months in advance. It was at a posh place and would’ve cost me my months wages but it would of spoiled her and made her happy so I could get around that. I’d bought nice clothes and she’d got a nice dress and all was going well.\\n\\nUp until the night before where, extremely tragically, one of my brothers closest friends died in a traffic collision. I didn’t know about this news until about 12ish the following day, about an hour before I was to pick her up. When I heard the news I immediately phoned her and told her I had to cancel and I explained the situation to her and saying that “I want to be here for him as much as I can incase he needs anything”. Expecting to hear a “yeah sure that’s fine I hope he’s okay”, I waited. Only to be on the receiving end of a less than pleased “K” before the call ended. \\n\\nAbout an hour later texts from her started coming through saying “you’ve ruined my day” “you never take me anywhere you always make up excuses” “you don’t love me, you never have”  “I should just fucking die cos you wouldn’t care” and the like from her. As well as “you’re the worst boyfriend” “ you’re so heartless” “how could you do such a thing to her” and others from her friends and family. I’m talking about mum, brother, sister, her whole friendship group. All calling me an asshole for it. \\n\\nI’m usually not swayed by general angry comments, I’m rather stubborn so I can mostly brush it off but this really hit me hard and made me question whether I did the right thing or whether I was the asshole here. \\n\\nPlease help, idk just need an answer to put the whole thing I rest in my mind as nearly a year later I’m still not over it. Many thanks :)\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Boy was I wrong!\\n\\nI had gotten off work early and thought I’d go surprise my gf. I got there to hear moaning and other odd noises. I went upstairs to find MY BROTHER IN BED WITH MY GIRLFRIEND! Needless to say, I was really pissed off. I stormed out and drove away. They tried calling me but I didn’t answer.\\n\\nI haven’t talked to them since then. That was 4 months ago.

The meetings are at night in the gym while the rest of the school is closed off and for the past few months, me and my best friend have been meeting up (since he also has a brother in the scouts) and sneaking away from the gym so that we can wander around the campus and basically have it all to ourselves at night. It\\'s a surprisingly fun time (we\\'re both only 16 so cut us a break) and we have a good time.\\n\\nLast night was the same: Me and my friend met up and slipped away from the meeting to roam the campus. We did our usual things: Messed around on the playground, stalked the janitor and made farting noises while hiding, and just enjoying the experience of being out on the campus by ourselves at nighttime. This time we decided to be a little riskier and we went to where the 8th grade classrooms were. We looked through the windows of our old 8th grade science classroom and we saw our old teacher sitting at her desk. We looked at her through the window a bit, but then we hid behind some bushes while she left the classroom and walked to a different part of campus. She had left her door unlocked and we snuck in the room. The first thing we went for was her drawer full of candy that she always had for well-behaved students. We loaded out pockets with candy and we started messing around the classroom. My friend wrote on the whiteboard \"THIS ROOM IS HAUNTED\" and while we were just messing around, we heard footsteps and we both hid. \\n\\nI hid in the supplies closet while my friend hid under a desk and I was scared. The teacher was back in the room and I could hear her. I heard her say \"What the hell?\" and I knew that she was either referring to the whiteboard or her sudden lack of candy. That\\'s when I could hear her footsteps walking around the room and I knew it was only a matter of time before she found us out. Then I heard her gasp and then she yelled my friend\\'s name. She found him and I knew I had to make a run for it. I went running out of the closet and covered my face with my hood and I looked back to see the teacher dragging my friend out from under the desk by his feet while he screamed his ass off. I just ran off back to the gym and lucky for me, the scout meeting was almost over. I just sat down and did my best to pick a spot to where the teacher couldn\\'t see me if she came in looking. The meeting soon ended and me and my brother were quick to drive off.\\n\\nThat all happened last night and I haven\\'t heard anything from anyone. All I know is that my friend was absent from school today and I knew that that wasn\\'t a good sign. I\\'m worried about getting found out, but I\\'m also worried about my friend\\'s reaction to towards me. Here\\'s the thing though: Back when we started sneaking around the school, me and him both agreed that it was every man for himself. So I\\'m thinking that I didn\\'t do anything wrong.

Everybody got home, we agreed on dinner, went and got it, ate and sat down to watch the movie when she piped up saying we couldn't start it till her boyfriend got there. I asked her when he was getting there, she said 2 hours. I felt that her waiting till the last possible second to drop that was.. rude? She didn't mention it at all before, during like the hour we were discussing food.\\n\\n\\nI have no *serious* plans, but I am suppose to chill with some friends later.

I told him that what we do transcends that.\\n\\nI told that person to be respectful and that he has never faced danger at every corner.  Not only did we do great investigations we do community meetings which hundreds show up to support us.  Our budget is only $10 million and that we have a skeleton team of only 80 people.  We have over 3000 cases a year filed and closed 1700 last year.  Yes, We are over two years behind only because of the shutdown.  The money is not enough and that we need it or another hitler will arise.  It’s hard to build coalitions s with limited funding.  Our old director destroyed us Andy set us back years and thousands of complaints are not lookied at yet.  It’s not our fault our funding needs to be doubled.

No big deal I eat fast, but the lunch line could possibly take 10ish minutes.\\nSo as soon as I get out of class I booked it to the lunchroom. Got there early there were maybe 10-12 people in front of me. People start lining up behind me, it's important to know that the door to the lunchroom is down at  some what narrow hall. So as I am waiting a girl starts walking past the line, and waves to her friends who is 4th or 5th in line who then motions for her to come there. At this point I know what is going on and I lean against the wall blocking the hall, I act like I don't know she is trying to cut and am just leaning on the wall for no reason. She walks up to me and asks to me to move, I ask why still playing dumb. She gives a bullsh*t excuse a bout trying to see what was for lunch ( I know this is bull because the menu is posted out side the hall). I tell her the menu, then she says let me through so I can wait with my friend. I say no cuts acting as if it had never crossed my mind that she would try and cut. She trys to to push past me and I again say no cuts. Then with a running start pushed through my arm I quickly grab the handle on her backpack and pull her back behind me. I would never have gotten physical if she hadn't first. Then she starts hitting my head repeatedly (b*tch was week). After 10-15 seconds a friend of mine pulled her off me and I stepped back she acted like nothing happened and cut in line to get lunch. She got in much more trouble than me. But I got a lot of flak for not just letting her cut. \\n\\nAm I the asshole \\n\\nPS. I didn't hit back\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nAlright, the relationship maps in this situation are a bit...messy, so I\\'m going to try my best to explain things fully and keep the information organized.  Fake names for everyone for probably obvious reasons.\\n\\nI\\'ve been dating my boyfriend (BF) for almost a year now.  We are both bi/pan and polyamorous.  He divorced his husband of 3 years a couple months before we met.  My interactions with ex-husband (EH) were mostly pleasant initially but over time BF and EH had some pretty huge fights and EH decided he didn\\'t like me.\\n\\nIn BF and EH\\'s friend group, everyone is super close and considers themselves like family.  EH used to date friend AB but that ended years ago.  AB has a younger sister (CD) who EH has taken a romantic/sexual interest in.  \\n\\n(Everyone in this situation is very much of adult age but CD is significantly younger than the rest of us by a good 5-10 years)\\n\\nAB forbid EH from dating CD (which I don\\'t think she had a right to do, but can understand why she would feel that way).  Instead of telling AB that they are both adults and she can\\'t forbid them from having a consenting relationship, EH and CD have been sneaking around behind AB\\'s back and lying to her about it for several months.  \\n\\nThe rest of us know this is happening but everyone has chosen to wash their hands of it and say that it is none of their business.  BF told CD that what she is doing (specifically the lying to AB part) is disrespectful and hurtful to someone he cares deeply for and that he would not lie for her if asked directly. \\n\\nCD said she would \"fix it\", but it turns out all she and EH did was tell AB that they have decided they want to start a relationship even though she doesn\\'t want them to.  They are pretending that they just started dating and are still lying to AB about having been dating each other for the past several months.\\n\\nBF has maintained that he won\\'t cover for them if asked directly, but I\\'m sick of letting them play games with the people we care about.  CD and I are very close, but AB and I have only just started to become friends and I don\\'t know if it\\'s my place to step in or not.\\n\\nI want to tell CD that she needs to come clean or that I will tell AB for her, but the fallout from that could be huge. EH will certainly be furious and see it as further reason to hate me. CD would most likely be upset with me. AB might not be happy I told her, but I truly don\\'t know how she would respond. Overall, this will cause everyone a lot of hurt, but the truth would be out there and everyone would be forced to deal with the situation in the open finally.\\n\\nSo....WIBTA if I gave CD the ultimatum and if I told AB what\\'s going on?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': 'So two of my coworkers were having a loud conversation in a common area about a traffic accident one was involved in. I foolishly offered my unsolicited opinion, unintentionally starting an argument in which I told him that he was “being an asshole” after he started yelling and told me to shut up. A couple of older employees that were watching immediately started yelling at me and scolding me for saying that. Apparently I crossed a line but he didn’t. \\n\\nLet’s call my coworker Mason. \\n\\nMason was basically bragging about how he taught some guy a lesson for driving recklessly. Mason was making a left turn at a two way green light and pulled out into the intersection to wait for a chance to go. He was waiting for drivers turning right at the opposite side of the intersection to pass before turning himself. A lot of people think that it is okay to turn right into the left lane. It’s not. \\n\\nMason could see in his rear view that the driver behind him was getting frustrated, saying something and making gestures directed at him. I’m not sure if he lingered to antagonize the guy but at some point the guy tried to make the turn while Mason waited in the intersection. \\n\\nMason watched the guy move and pulled forward, purposefully timing the move so the driver would be unable to avoid colliding with him. He mentioned wishing that he was driving his truck so he could have pushed the guy into oncoming traffic. \\n\\nHe believes that the other driver is at fault because he had the right of way and I disagree because he intentionally pulled forward to make the accident happen.\\n\\nI told him that I think what he did was wrong and dangerous and that I think he is at fault for the accident. He asked how and repeatedly declared that he had the right of way as I responded, raising his voice over mine. I told him that drivers have a moral and legal obligation to drive safely and prevent collisions and he objected, asking rhetorically to show him where that’s written and answering that it’s not and telling me to shut up because I don’t know what I am talking about. \\n\\nIt was at this point that I told him that he is “being an asshole”. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I did butt into someone else’s conversation and that may have been a dick move but I think that it’s perfectly okay to engage someone in conversation about something you disagree on. \\n',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nOkay so growing up (ages 12 -22ish) I had this friend I’ll call Sam. Sam came from a rough family life, rougher than mine, where her mom literally traded sex for drugs and her father wasn’t much better. My house, as chaotic as it was and is, was far more stable and we were glad to take her in as a pseudo family member. My dad even taught her to drive and he never taught me to drive (this comes up later). We did a lot for her but I am glad we could do that, everyone deserves some help.\\nWell over the years there had been a few instances where she was completely in the wrong but I forgave her. Like one time her brothers got taken away by DSS and I didn’t know it yet and she was giving me attitude so I asked why she was being a bitch and she beat the hell out of me and I didn’t even swing back. I forgave her though, we were young and it was clearly a very shitty day for her. \\nFast forward a few years and she looks at me and tells me that I’m a loser and she can’t have me as a friend anymore because ‘I can’t even drive’. She completely forgets the fact that it was my dad that taught her how to do it and that he refused to do the same for me but I just let her go because if someone calls you a loser there’s no real incentive to hold on to them.\\nFast forward again about a year and she comes to me with an arm sling on because her shoulder is broken. She’s been in a relationship with this guy who I’ll call douche-canoe, well DC broke her arm and it wasn’t the first time he had hurt her. She shows up at my door step out of the blue after not talking to me for a year and asks for help. The very next day I am at her apartment helping her pack and douche-canoe comes in and calls me a fat-cunt and threatens to beat my ass. In a daze I just tell him that he’s a bad person which was a good call because it apparently triggered the scared little boy in him and he shut down and started to try to win me over. (I know that abusers will do this). Anyhow I manage to get us out of the apartment with most of her stuff because he wants me to like him and I’m toeing the line to stay safe and not die in this situation. We get out of there. The next day she goes back with my sister and another friend and DC tries to run her car off the road with his car and they report him so he has a warrant out. He calls my house because he copied my number from her phone apparently the day we went over there and threatens to go ‘dig up his guns’ that he ‘burried’ to shoot me and I call the police. So two warrants now. \\nHe finally gets arrested a day or two later when I went back with Sam to go get her cat from the apartment thinking he wouldn’t be there because the cops were looking for him. Luckily we spotted his car outside and just called the cops so they went in and arrested him and we were able to get everything we wanted out, including the cat with out incident. \\nA month or so goes by and Sam and I are hanging out all the time again. I forgave her, I figured maybe the abusive relationship played into her abandoning the friendship and I try not to take previous loser comments personally. We go out to the club one night and for some stupid reason we go home with a guy we met there. Things are fine for the most part until like it gets a little later and people make it clear that it’s time to get down or get out. Sam wanted to hook up with the room mate of the guy we went home with and I admittedly volunteered to give the guy oral sex. That wasn’t enough though and next thing I know I was assaulted, called a whore and he panicked. I try to tell Sam what happened but she’s ‘busy’ so she dismisses me and the guy we came home with asks for her car keys and the bitch gives them to him. He takes off with her car for four fucking hours. For the first hour I was laying on the couch, alone, sobbing as Married with Children played on a T.V in the background (a show I still can not watch and this happened in 2010 and I loved that show). She and the guy she hooked up with came out and told me to stop crying and that I liked what happened and I had been flirting all night.\\nThe guy we came home with eventually comes back around 8 a.mish with her car and I RUN outside to it and she staggers out a few moments later. She refuses to take me to a hospital or to look for a planned parenthood, insisting I was over-reacting. I stay silent for the car ride home but as soon as I get home my sister luckily was willing to take me to get plan B just incase, I never reported anything because I had figured if my friend who was with me at the time thought it was my fault what would the police think? \\nI wrote Sam a letter that day though and told her that we could no longer be friends because of how she has treated me historically and how I was so willing to help her in a situation that argueably she had more choice in than I had, had that night and I never blamed her for being there. \\nShe comes to my house that night wanting to beat me up and my sister again saves me because my sister and I have a lot of issues but she will beat the fuck out of a bitch to protect me if need be. \\nSam also decided about 4 years later when my grandmother died that ‘she was the only one who could understand me’ and came to my house after messaging me and I told her no, I never wanted to see her again, especially that night.\\nFast forward to this past weekend, she messaged my mother. Sam has a daughter that is about 9 now and is into art. My mother is an artist and an extremely talented one at that. Sam asks for art lessons from my mom and my mom instead of just saying outright ‘no’ asks me what I think. Well what I think is fuck Sam and anything that she’s related to I don’t want them in my life or near my family. I get that it’s not her daughter’s fault and her daughter might even be an artist with great potential that deserves encouragement. I still stand by my first impulse though which is a firm 1000% no, no help for Sam or her family. Am I wrong for this? I mean It’s not her kids fault but having her daughter involved in my moms life means having her involved and that is just something I don’t think I could deal with. I just feel like a jerk because I know kid’s shouldn’t be punished for the sins of a parent but don’t I deserve peace of mind as well? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'link_flair_text': '',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'I know I\\'m probably sounding a bit ungrateful right now. Being annoyed that someone tried to do something for me. But please let me explain. This happened this last Christmas, but it\\'s been bugging me a bit so I feel I have to ask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI was out shopping with my mother, both of us trying to get some Christmas shopping done. We\\'d spent most of the day looking through stuff together, but then we split up for a short while. We were in a big shopping center, and both of us wanted to take a look in different stores. So we split up for a bit. When we met up again, she began showing me some of the things she had bought.\\n\\nAnd then she handed me something, telling me that I no longer had to worry about buying a present for a friend of mine. I was confused at first. But then she explained that she saw this thing, and thought it was something my friend would like. So she bought it, telling me to give it to him for Christmas. Marked as being from me. She bought my Christmas gift to my friend, for me. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI wasn\\'t too thrilled about this. Partly because I put a lot of thought into the gifts I buy, and it felt weird that I didn\\'t pick this one out myself. But mostly, because it felt...wrong? A gift is something you give to someone to show you care. That\\'s the whole point of Christmas. You have someone close to you, so you give them something to show you appreciate them. I just felt that giving my friend a gift that *my mother* bought was a bit...insincere. It wouldn\\'t have been from me.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nNot only that, but I am a grown adult. I understand that a mother bear still feels the need to mother, even when the cubs are all grown up. But I\\'m capable of picking out and paying for gifts myself. I wasn\\'t shopping with her that day because I *needed* to, but because I *wanted* to. It was meant to be a fun shopping trip to spend time together and stuff. I didn\\'t in any way expect her to buy anything for me. And it seems a little weird at my age to be handing out Christmas presents that my mother picked out. Especially since it was for one of my friends, not a family member or anything. Plus, I enjoy the gift-shopping process. It makes me happy when I find something I just know will make someone else happy. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAnd to add to that, we were both in the same building at the time. Different stores, yes. But both stores are located in the same main building. We weren\\'t that far from each other, and it wasn\\'t anywhere near close to closing time. Plus, we both had our phones with us. She made no attempt to call, text, or even just come find me before just going ahead and buying it. Didn\\'t run it buy me, or ask if she should get it. No communication whatsoever.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSo taking all of the above into account, I was slightly annoyed  when she handed me this thing. Not angry or anything. Just mildly irritated. But I wasn\\'t going to say anything at first. I said thanks, even. And was just gonna roll with it, because I knew she was just trying to be helpful. But it must have shown on my face that I wasn\\'t all that enthusiastic about it, because she asked what was wrong. I didn\\'t want to go into detail on every reason I didn\\'t like it, though. I didn\\'t want an argument, so I just tried to casually say something along the lines of \"oh, I was just hoping to pick something out myself, that\\'s all. But this is fine! I think he\\'ll like it\". \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nBut she wouldn\\'t drop it. She asked why I wanted to pick it out myself. I was treading carefully at this point. I love my mother, but she has a heck of a temper. I could sense she was getting annoyed, and I just wanted to let it go. But she kept asking *why* I wasn\\'t happy she\\'d done that. I was trying to word my responses carefully, but made the mistake of saying it was the \"principle\" of it. He\\'s my friend, so I should buy his present. And. She. *Exploded.* \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThat set her off yelling at me. \" *Principle?!* What principle? There\\'s no *principle* about it! Does it matter who bought it? He won\\'t know you didn\\'t pick it!\" Yelling all sorts of things about how I was ungrateful, and should just have accepted the help. And I get where she\\'s coming from. She was only trying to help. I get it, and I am grateful that she does try and help me. But I feel that this particular occasion, she overstepped a little. I was right there in the same building. It wouldn\\'t have been hard to ask me first.\\n\\nAnd also I was only mildly irritated, at best. I feel she overreacted by yelling like that when I tried to explain why I felt that way. Not to mention, I didn\\'t even say anything until she asked. But at the same time, she was just trying to help. And now I feel like I\\'m in the wrong for not appreciating it as much as I should. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis incident ruined what was a perfectly good outing at first, but we\\'re both over it by now. She ended up keeping the gift and giving it to someone she knew, while I got to pick out a new gift myself. We\\'ve all moved on. But it still bugs me sometimes. So what do you guys think? Am I right to be annoyed she did that without asking me? Or am I just ungrateful for not appreciating the help? AITA here?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTL:DR-- My mother bought something for me to give to my friend as a Christmas present from myself (without asking me first). She then got angry that I would rather pick something out myself.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nEdit- I just want to make it a bit clearer that my first response was to say thanks, and try to drop the subject. The conversation only continued because she sensed I wasn\\'t happy and kept asking me what was wrong. I wasn\\'t gonna say anything until she asked',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nLittle backstory. Met this girl we will call Natalie (21, I\\'m 32) at my work. I work at a casino, she is a player, and I work nights and weekends. Started dating immediately. Everything was great. All of our time was spent with each other or talking to each other. We dated for a month, but during that time I was falling for her, could see a future, and we talked about future trips and dates. \\nOn 12/30 we have an amazing date. She wanted to go to church but said she wasn\\'t ready for me to meet her family yet. That is fine with me as I thought it was still a bit early to meet family. We go to brunch and a Dave & Busters and then back to her place for some fun before I had to go to work. Best date I have probably ever been on. Everything was just natural.\\nOn 1/3 she sends me a text that says we need to talk (she is sick and can\\'t talk). We text (since deleted so don\\'t remember exactly what was said) and she says she isn\\'t sure if she can continue dating me because we would never see each other with our work schedules (she is about to start a normal hr internship) and school and that she is going through a lot of stuff (she wouldn\\'t talk about it) and needs to focus on herself. I sort of agree but tell her that I don\\'t want to lose her and I would do whatever I could to fight for us. Talk kind of ends in what seems like a \\'break\\' instead of actually breaking up. Like, I need some time to think about things. After that it is pretty much a chore for her to talk to me. \\nDuring this time she had been hanging out with a guy that a coworker had try to set her up with, we will call him Kyle. When Natalie and I started dating we laughed that my coworker had tried to set her up with Kyle and we give coworker crap because he knew I was interested in Natalie. Kyle becomes Natalie\\'s realtor. Natalie and I couldn\\'t hang out on NYE because of previous plans before we got together but we agreed I would try to meet up with her. She ends up going to my work (where I can\\'t go if I\\'m not working) so I\\'m not happy because she knows I can\\'t go there. My work is on the way home from where I am at NYE. Have a DD. Offer to pick up Natalie on way home and she stay at my place. She said that Kyle was taking her home cuz he was sober and lives up her way. 2 days later is when she sends me the message of us needing to talk.\\nOn 1/7, a Monday, I meet up with Natalie to give her a present that I had ordered for her after our 12/30 date. She was almost out of this perfume that she loved but it was discontinued so she couldn\\'t find any. I had found it that night and ordered it for her. I give it to her, we talk for a little bit and still won\\'t really open up. Still says she is going through a lot with career change and high possibility of moving to a different state (new news to me) and that she had been thinking of relapsing (not sure if just Mary J or possibly Molly) and needed to focus on herself. I let her know that I will give her the space she needs but that I am there for her. If she needs to talk just to let me know. Natalie and I didn\\'t talk again until 1/12, Saturday.\\nFound out from coworker that she went on a date with someone the next night, Tuesday 1/8. 5 days later, Friday, I\\'m at work and coworker says something about Natalie and I said that it wasn\\'t going on anymore. He said it was obvious. She was coming in to my work with Kyle more. She came in with him on Saturday and I had to help both of them. We don\\'t really talk the entire time. She sends me a message that night that says it was good to see me. I respond with you too. She replied with I hope you are doing alright. I said honestly, no I have been a lot better and ask her how she is. She said she was about the same and then immediately sends another that says she is going to bed, goodnight (why send those messages if you aren\\'t going to talk). This was at about 430 am (technically Sunday I guess). I had sent her a message before all this just asking her to bring my stuff with her next time she was at my work and I would have hers. No response, so I send another (about 8 hrs later) that said or we can meet up sometime and exchange everything. No response.\\nShe sends a message Sunday around 2pm that says she knows my coworker told me she was sleeping with Kyle. I immediately responded with no, he didn\\'t. For how long. She responded with \\'well now you know and a couple days\\'... So either a week and half or maybe 4 days after we broke up she is sleeping with someone else. I tell her how much she means to me and how much she hurt me even though I know we aren\\'t together. She just says \"sorry, I don\\'t know what I want. I\\'m going through a lot. Kyle and I are seeing each other but I wouldn\\'t consider it dating\". I respond with \"just let me know when you can meet up to exchange our stuff\". Atleast 4 different occasions she said we would try to meet up on x afternoon and I would hear NOTHING. She comes in to my work with Kyle on 1/27 and I go on break and send her a message asking if she brought it. She said no she forgot. I said we have to meet up within next couple days to exchange so I can get over this crap (it was really more about meeting up and hopefully talking and saying goodbye and getting some closure, hopefully). She said we would try Monday afternoon. I say just let me know when and where. 630pm rolls around and I have heard nothing. I\\'m pissed. Send a long ass message basically saying that it is obvious she doesn\\'t care about me or how I feel or she would atleast have the courtesy to let me know she couldn\\'t meet up and try another day and that she made me feel like I am nothing and our time together was nothing by jumping into something else after she told me she needed to focus on herself. Thank her for the time we had together as I enjoyed getting to know her. Say she played me and played me well and she gave me more reason to stay single. Tell her best of luck and goodbye. She responded with, what felt like, a half-assed non-caring response. \"I have the flu. I\\'m not jumping into anything right now, I relapsed so focusing on me. Sorry that I hurt you. Never my intentions. Struggling and don\\'t know how to talk about it. Again. I\\'m really sorry. Don\\'t stay single, you deserve to be happy. Sorry I made you feel the opposite. I\\'ll bring your stuff next time I\\'m at work\". I don\\'t respond. It has been the last message between the two of us.\\nShe has still been seeing Kyle during this time, oh and they have been going to meetings together (like AA) for a while, even when we were dating. She never told me about it until after we broke up. So they would go to a meeting at night and then come to my work together at like 11pm. Confirmed last night that they are actually dating now. Not sure how long but it has been almost a month since we broke up. She can\\'t even look at me and won\\'t say anything to me other than if it has to do with what I\\'m helping them with.\\nWIBTA for finally just having that \\'f you\\' outburst message and tell her that she is untrustworthy and a liar? That I hope when she sees me or thinks of me she feels a fraction of the pain and hurt that I feel? That when she sees/uses the presents I got her that she thinks of me? That she should warn Kyle that she is going to leave him out of nowhere for another guy? Or should I just continue not talking to her and just let it be?\\nI just want to be done with everything to do with her. I want to quit my job so I don\\'t have to see her/them. I want to be able to move on. She absolutely destroyed me and made me feel like I\\'m nothing by jumping into something else so quick after telling me she needed time to focus on herself.\\nOh and she still hasn\\'t brought my stuff to work and I have thrown her stuff in the dumpster.\\n\\nTL;DR : GF dumps me for reason of probably not going to be able to see each other due to work schedules and that she is going through stuff and needing to focus on herself. All the while talking and hanging out with a guy my coworker had tried to set her up with the day before we started dating. They started sleeping together a week and half (maybe 4 days) after we actually broke up. Now actually dating. Can I have the \\'f you\\' blow up text/talk?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': \"Some context: wife (28F) and I (29M) have been trying for a kid for years. It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's. \\n\\nAs an aside, even if for profit surrogacy is illegal, we provided the surrogate with prenatal vitamins, some pregnancy clothing, we even went to dinner a few times on us. I know it doesn't compare to the emotional/physical cost of pregnancy, but she appreciated it and didn't ask for more.\\n\\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \\n\\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\\n\\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\\n\\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\\n\\nMy sister (31F) has a child with DS, he was born 3 years ago. She was career oriented, got a full sports scholarship ride through university, and in my opinion had a picturesque life. Now her boyfriend left her, she hasn't worked since, she relies on benefits, and is generally very unhappy by her own admission. I look at this example as one where these things can have a ginormous (negative) impact on your life. I know examples exist where things go smoothly, but this is the only first hand experience I know of.\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So this originally started about 2 months ago. I was planning on moving out 2 month before our lease ends (February)  and my roommate, (lets call her Ashley) allowed her friends to come and takeover the apt. Mind you they moved all my stuff out overnight into a UHaul that i didnt ask for and wanted me to pay them $150 for getting me a truck..  \\n\\nThis started a big fight between me, ashley and her 2 friends what were taking over the apt. They said they would pay the rent and utilities for the remaining 2 months. Granted my name along with Ashleys are on the lease so i know they cant do much without ashley taking a hit. We are both in our early 20s. Im 23 shes 21. They day after i moved my stuff and them still messaging me to pay them the $150 for the truck i told Ashley that i was stopping the electric service there on 12/10. I moved out and told her this on 12/3. I gave her a week to call and start service in her name. \\n\\nNow we are here in February and move out day is the 3rd. I havent lived there since December and she sent me a photo of the electric bill. Apparently the apt complex keeps the power running in Florida regardless if tenants are in the unit.  so they assumed we stopped paying and she wants me to pay half of the bill. I told her that i informed her about everything going on with electric. I have messages from her stating that she was going to call the electric company as well as her friends stating they would pay the rent and utilities. Now they are throwing threats at me and im not having it. \\n\\nI told her i am NOT going to pay for electricity at a place i dont live in. She wanted them to stay with her. I told her multiple times that they were going to have issues, but shes very nieve and believed everything her friends told her. They tried saying they would fuck me over and promised none of it would have any negative effects on her.  Isaid that im willing to let the mgmt take the cost out of the security deposit.  (Which she thinks isnt fair) \\n\\nSo thats how my morning is going so far. I am going to the complex office this afternoon to give them my key and ask that our security deposit is split into 2 separate checks. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I don\\'t date. Like almost never. Since high school I\\'ve had two girlfriends and maybe a dozen first dates. All of them end in disinterest from either her or me. From my perspective the women that I attract are not the highest caliber or class. So here I am at 40 and my life resembles a Steve Carrell movie. \\n\\nSo when I start talking to a girl on OKCupid my expectations were low. We flirt and her lifestyle as a submissive is not appealing to me but she\\'s actually a great conversation. Let\\'s call her S.\\n\\nAs we text and flirt she sends me pics that get progressively dirty. She even sent them while I was at work and my boss saw one over my shoulder and dropped his laptop.\\n\\nEventually she found herself a \"Joker to her Harley\" as she put it and the texts and pics tapped off. She moves in with him. But, the J & H relationship was wholly unstable like its namesake and collapsed quickly.\\n\\nShe ran to me for comfort and solace. And to her ex husband for the \"craving for a master\" as well as a place to live.\\n\\nShe loses her job as a hotel maid unnessecarily having walked away from being groped instead of reporting the guy. When she finally does they fire him but since she walked without explanation they would give her job back.\\n\\nBeing unemployed she falls back on her masseuse career and gets busted for having her license expired. She needs $200 to renew or she\\'s completely out of options.\\n\\nI meet her for the very first time and give her the cash to help her out. When she showed up she\\'s so nervous that when I handed her the bills she was worried that she would be arrested. I asked, why? No one cares. I tell her it\\'s not a loan and there are no strings attached just use it to get on her feet. (I really had no designs on her)\\n\\nShe gets back to her massage business and starts making some good money. \\n\\nThe Joker returned and swept her off her feet again. She moved back in with him. This lasted even less time than before, when she breaks again she can\\'t move in with her ex husband because he found himself another submissive. The two do not want her there. On top of that while trying to earn a little more she took a job as a personal assistant to a disabled person that turned out to be a fraud. He\\'d made her deposit a payroll check that she had deposited into her bank, withdrawing that money and depositing it into his account. By the time the $5k xheck bounced the guy was gone. The bank was going to press charges on her if the funds were not returned.\\n\\nI had a vacant room and offered her a place rent free to get her on her feet. I even build a bed for her out of spare 2x4s.\\n\\nWhile living here she and I would talk, flirt. She had no qualms about nudity and once just for punctuation to a conversation she dropped every article of clothing in two seconds flat. While she is far from being unattractive physically she still lacked the one and only thing I look for in a woman.\\n\\nSo months go by and she finds another guy and another guy. Dating both at the same time. Both end fairly quickly and after six months she\\'s still not working. I floated the idea of finding her own place after she finds a job at a weed dispensary. \\n\\nThat\\'s when she tells me she\\'s pregnant and she doesnt know whose it is. She can\\'t even find one of them. She would much rather stay here since she feels it\\'s a safe place.\\n\\nMy other roommate at the time, let\\'s call him D, had become friends with S and smokes out front together just outside the downstairs bathroom. Shortly after saying she pregnant I did not mean to eavesdrop, I just had to go to the bathroom. I overhear D ask what she\\'s going to do with the baby. S replies, \"I\\'m not pregnant but he won\\'t kick me out if he thinks i am\"\\n\\nI kicked her out. She claimed I was heartless, she had nowhere to go but didnt budge. I never let on that I knew she was not pregnant. I just knew that if she didn\\'t go then she would never go. She left. Blocked me on FB and began spreading lies about me in her posts.\\n\\nAITA?',\n",

She would also send coursemates to me with reminders to do stuff, and prevent me from doing certain things because I'd do it too slowly apparently. I put together a tube of reagents we both needed for a future experiment and she watched me do it only to say she'd prefer if we'd used one she'd done. I have dyspraxia so I do things a little bit slower but it doesn't mean that I did anything poorly. \\n\\nAnyway, we're doing the write-up now and she keeps messaging me asking for help. She said she wants to share ideas with me. However, I know what I'm doing, I kinda feel like that's her problem and I don't want to risk being seen as colluding. I feel like I might be TA though because this is an important piece of work and we're getting close to a deadline, but she's stuck.\\n\\n**tl;dr: Girl who I had a poor working relationship with now wants my help.**\",\n",

In the game, you are able to make a clan which allows you to research new abilities, trade with your clanmates, and be able to build things in the \"Clan Dojo.\"\\n\\nA couple of friends and I started a new dojo with one of us as the clan leader ( they are able to kick anyone, destroy things, etc.). We soon realized that some rules would need to be put in place in order for the whole clan to not be a mess, so one of these rules was that it was not allowed to build anything without the clan leader\\'s permission. \\n\\nFast forwards a couple of weeks and the clan leader made two rooms. I asked them what they were for and they said that one of these rooms would be mine (personalized rooms are not necessary for a clan, but it made it more fun) and I could choose which one mine would be. \\n\\nThe next day, I decided which room I wanted and started to build things in it (doesn\\'t really matter what\\'s in the room) without the clan leader\\'s approval. I finished laying out everything I wanted in the room and started to farm for about 2 hours for the materials needed to get them. After the farming, I started production on everything... it would take about a day to finish.\\n\\nThe next morning I log on and I find that everything in the room was gone; all destroyed by the clan leader. Now, when things are destroyed, you get all of your materials back, but I was still very mad. After talking to the clan leader on discord (all be it in a very angry way), they said that they destroyed it because I didn\\'t get permission from them. \\n\\nI\\'m still pretty mad at my friend for destroying what I built, but I also see how I was in the wrong. So AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nDISCLAIMER : GRAPHIC CONTENT\\nFirst off some background: My grandfather was a pedophile and I saw him make my sister touch him. I grew up really having a problem with sex. My father was also an alcoholic so I didn't have the strongest male role and my parents really struggled with their marriage and of course that made an impression. I was very sexually charged as a kid, making my toys do things, creating strange scenarios with my mind etc. I started really heavily getting into porn at the age of 8/9ish and have been really struggling with it. At the age of 12, I started going into online chat rooms and role playing with older men and would lie about my age, this went on for about 6 months. I met my ex when I was 13 and he was 14, we started dating around the time I turned 14 and him 15. He was severely depressed and so was I. He was very manipulative even if it wasn't intentional, he didn't like me having friends so I didn't, my relationship with my family was already rocky and our relationship made it worse between me and them. Whenever we got in a fight he would tell his friends(which were my friends by proxy) what I had said and they would take his side and confront me. He was the only person I had left and I was extremely reliant on him and he influenced my self esteem heavily. Our relationship turned sour in about a month but I stayed with him for about 6. I tried to leave him multiple times but he would say he was going to kill himself and he would promise to change time after time. Another reason I stayed with him as long as I did is because my family are devote Christians (as am I) and they look down on premarital sex; after I had messed around with once him I felt like I had to stay with him because no one else would want me, I felt like damaged goods. He knew all of my history, with my father and my grandfather, the chat rooms etc. and in much more detail.\\n\\n\\nThe problem: We agreed to take things slow but of course we were teenagers and we flirted a lot and talked about sexual actions. Things started getting heavier and about a month in he told me he was attracted to my sister. My self esteem was very low even before he told me but this just made everything worse. He cried, and begged me to forgive him, so I did. After that he started touching my breasts and was getting aroused. I was just as stimulated but I felt guilty but I went along with it anyway. Long story short I ended up giving him a blowjob before we had even kissed the first time. He keep pushing me to let him do things and I had a hard time saying no so I let him do it. Time went on and we were messing around every time we saw each other and to be honest I initiated it, I would ask him to touch my chest and things would escalate from there. He would ask me to give him handjobs and oral sex and I would comply. I felt guilty right after, everytime. Our relationship worsened because he didn't want to stop watching porn and it killed me. I felt like I had to satisfy him so he wouldn't go looking for it anywhere else. I usually initiated it and sometimes I did want to go further because it felt good but I kept regretting it. Our relationship kept getting worse and I told him that I didnt want to mess around with him anymore until we sorted out problems out and to deny me even if I did initiate something. We would have some good patches and that's usually when I tried to do stuff with him and he would tell me no once or twice and then give in. I hated myself for doing it but it was like I couldn't stop. Each time I felt more and more worthless. There was one line I wouldn't cross, I wouldn't have sex with him. He didn't like that at all, we argued about it a lot. One particular time he grabbed my face and was yelling at me because I stonewalled. Things ended very messy with me going to a mental health facility for the night, and getting the cops called on me for trying to runaway after my mom had told me she read all our messages. I wanted to be friends with him but we would constantly fight and he was very hostile. He would text my mom late at night with depressed messages etc. Finally I broke off contact with him but he still kept contacting me through his friends. Eventually it stopped and I was getting better, I was now on antidepressants and repairing my relationships with my family. Recently, he contacted me through his friend, and said that I was the abusive one an all these memories got dragged back up. I blame him but is it my fault? Did he take advantage of me or is that something I just tell myself to feel better and rationalize it? \\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a good friend and for privacy  I will call her Taylor. She has a BF named Jack. They are super drfity ngl, only messaging each other every few days at best (now at different schools). A childhood friend, again for privacy I\\'ll name Markus. He ghosted me when I got in Middle School (was never good enough to meet his expectations it crushed me ngl) and he got a hand job by this guy I will name Micah. He got so embarrased he went to a boarding school in the next town. We were discussing this in my Digital Technology class. Jack told me \"Markus followed my advice - first time it is am experiment, second time it is gay\" so I was laughing, not thinking it twice.\\n\\nNext day I thought about what he said and asked him if he got a hand job from Micah. He was like \"Yeah lol!! Also Markus gave Micah one too.\" and I was like ok yeah ok lmao. Then at night I was messaging Taylor because hey why not, we are close. I made a joke abt Jack getting the hand job and she was like \"WAIT WHAT\" so I explained and then an argument happened via instagram.exe\\n\\nNext day I asked Jack if him and Taylor were still together. He got pissy and walked away (Reasonable, I should have thought it through but oh well.) \\n\\nAnd then later Taylor told me they were still going out (she thinks) and I was just like \"im glad u worked it out :)\" and then she went on abt this other guy she liked and how he made her weak and that she loves him. Jack seemed kind of sad.\\n\\nAITA for making them unfaithful to eachother? Should I have just let it slide?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He says he had released some confidential documents but get this, that’s not even why he’s here. \\n\\nA few years prior he had been accused of raping two women in Sweden, and after he left the country, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant, which resulted in a trial in the UK or something. So when he lost the trial, this guy decided the best to do was to ask for my for political asylum...? Like dude, that so random since my country is fairly small and obscure, located in Latin America, and I knew right off the beat that this guy was just trying to use me. \\n\\nWhen my secretary forwarded his request to me, I was just like do whatever you want; I don’t have time for this. And then what do you know, the UK law enforcement shows up outside of the embassy trying to arrest this dude but they can’t go inside due to diplomatic immunity. But this Julian guy cant leave either because he’ll get arrested immediately. So one party can’t go inside and the other can’t leave. \\n\\nThis guy has literally been staying inside the embassy for 6 whole years now. He’s a complete slob who doesn’t know how to behave and neglects personal hygiene. He skates inside the embassy and won’t clean up his only friend’s poop which is his cat. Not only that but I had authorized his Ecuadorian citizenship, hoping this would be an incentive to get his act together. I don’t know anymore. I feel like I should just push him out of there and let the UK government arrest him or something. \\n\\nTL;DR some wannabe hacker doesn’t want to be extradited to the US for leaking classified docs, but really his charges were that he allegedly raped two women, and is now holed up in my country’s embassy to avoid charges. \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo I posted on here a little while ago about the person I\\'m currently living with \\n\\nKL-Kind Lady\\n\\nOh geez how I want to just take back that Kind status and change it to Absent.\\n\\nSo I ended up telling KL that I was moving out but I couldn\\'t do this in person. Oh no. I had to do this by a note because KL didnt get home til 11pm. KL came home, got ready for bed, told me off about the dishes I was just about to do and then went to bed.\\n\\nSo I left KL a note and honestly felt like that was informal as hell. When I was at home next. KL told me that she had read the note and was sad that I was moving out. Asking if she had done anything wrong. I lied my freaking ass off saying \"oh no. It\\'s just the distance from work is too far\" not like I wasnt getting access to necessities and my food was being stolen and just no respect for the fact that I do work.  \\n\\nTurns out the students KL was talking to me about the other week needed a place and she was able to say to them that there was two rooms available now. Not even a day and KL was already telling people hey you can come live here soon\\n\\nI mean I\\'ve wanted out for a while but nothing more has made me want to move out faster than the past 2 nights.\\n\\n*Night 1*\\n\\n4pm. Come home from work tired and sleep for 4 hours\\n\\n8pm. hear banging on the front door. Soon after KL\\'s family is near my window asking me to open the door because surprise surprise. KL isnt home. AGAIN. \\n\\nI go unlock the door and just go back to my room because I was not dressed for guests. So I stayed in there. \\n\\n9/10pm. No one is home. And I mean no one. Which is weird. So I wait around and see if anyone comes home.\\n\\n11pm. Nothing\\n\\n12am. Nothing \\n\\n1am. I\\'m getting paranoid as hell because I can hear people outside the house\\n\\n2am. I finally decide to go to sleep cause I couldn\\'t stay up any longer and my paranoid ass just had to deal with whatever my overactive imagination was gonna give me.\\n\\n*Night 2*\\n\\n8pm. No one else is home. Which is fine like it\\'s still light out\\n\\n9pm. Nothing\\n\\n10pm. Nothing\\n\\n11pm. I\\'m getting worried again because there are noises again and I straight up hate how paranoid and anxious I get about being home alone\\n\\n11.30pm. Let my family know that hey they aren\\'t home what the hell do I do as I have work in the morning and I just don\\'t feel safe being left home alone.\\n\\n12am. They finally come home. And I am ticked off because I have work early again tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n2 nights in a row and there was no heads up and my anxious paranoid ass is freaking out because I can hear noises outside. And it was useless trying to text KL. No replies to any of my texts since August. ITS FREAKING FEBRUARY.\\n\\nBut it\\'s gonna be like a few more nights of sleeping here. Spending my days off with my family cause why the hell not clearly dont get any respect around here.\\n\\nSo am I the asshole for thinking how KL handled me telling her I was moving out was just not right? And am I the asshole for  being mad that KL for being out very late the last two nights?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': 'First post here! I apologize for any spelling errors/length of this post. I’m typing on my phone!\\n\\nSome backstory - this girl was my close friend in high school. We had a falling out towards the end of high school.\\nFast forward a few years later, we had made up and everything was cool between us. At this point, I had been working retail for a company we both love for about a year (I’m not sure I can say as I don’t want to risk getting in trouble - I’ll say that it’s a store that can be seen as a children’s store.. this is important). We both had loved this company since childhood and it was one of the things that always bonded us. She really hated her job at the time, and I decided to help out since she always said my job is great. \\n\\nI told her to apply, and told my manager about her and how I felt she’d be a good fit for the store. I hyped her up for the interview, and she got it! We were both really excited and I was really happy for her as she did seem genuinely excited.\\n\\nFast forward 2 months later and pretty much all of our coworkers dislike her and complain to me about her. They all say that she complains constantly, is too slow on cash, comes in late or misses shifts altogether. She also complains about how “far away” she lives from the store (20 minute bus ride..) which doesn’t make sense to me since she knew where she was applying. I keep telling them to speak with management if they really are so upset, as there’s nothing I can do (they probably just want to rant without actually causing a problem).\\n\\nNow I’ve been in the hot seat before with management and know that it isn’t fun. She tends to get nervous in those situations so I decided to talk about it with her, but toned it down very much. I essentially just told her that we work in an environment in which we need to be very cheerful, so you can’t really go around joking about killing yourself. This prompted her to start crying about how everyone in the store is working against her, and how she doesn’t get praised for doing things right.\\n\\nShes now been working there for 6 months, management has cut her hours due to her behaviour at work (which has of course made her complain). I feel bad since I’m the one who recommended her, despite my manager telling me he picked her to interview before my recommendation.\\n\\nAITA for kind of wanting her to get fired at this point?\\n\\n*EDIT: We had a few seasonal employees during Christmas time, one of whom was an amazing fit. He was enthusiastic, cheerful and very helpful. He unfortunately needed to be let go at the end of the season because there just weren’t enough hours to keep him on. Since then I’ve been especially bitter since he lost out on a job and she gets to keep hers. ',\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI don\\'t really know how to start this off but I guess i\\'ll give some context\\n\\nI am a teenage internet dweller that has been diagnosed with being bipolar, autistic and I also have anger issues.\\n\\nI spend most of my time on my computer and have a close friend group of about 5-6 people that I talk to everyday and recently a new person has been joining us every now and then, we\\'ll call him M.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t really thought much of the guy, he seemed sweet, studied in college etc.\\n\\nToday I had a really bad day and my anxiety was through the roof and that usually triggers my anger quite a bit. To make a long story a little shorter I was pretty upset and after something happened in the game we were playing I had a little bit of a breakdown (yes I know it is childish to get mad over video games) It\\'s not a big deal and usually I just kind of punch something and then move on. Obviously this isn\\'t healthy but I\\'ve gotten used to it and so have my friends (most of them find it funny, which I don\\'t mind) but M seemed to get quite upset, and he blurred out \"do all people in this group have mental issues or something\" which obviously made me even more angry. My friends did their best to tell M that I had some issues and that I couldn\\'t help it but M didn\\'t listen. He told me that I am being childish and immature and that I \"had some serious issues I needed to see a professional to solve\".\\n\\nI should have said this earlier but I go to a school psychiatrist 3 times a week during normal classes to try and control myself during school. Because of this comment he made I got very angry at him and tried to explain to him why you shouldn\\'t say that type of thing to anyone, and it is very insulting for a person with psychological issues. He then for some reason tried to save the situation by saying that he has had depression for 5 years. Obviously I felt bad for him but I was just so upset and disappointed by what he had said that I simply didn\\'t give a shit. I then told him that if he has had or does have mental issues he should know not to say those kinds of things to people and after that he swiftly left the call. I was shaking like I do a lot when my anger sets in and I knew it was best if I left the call for a bit and went for a walk to calm me down. When I came back home I got back on my PC and tried to join back the call to play some games, but I noticed my \"friends\" had taken away my ability to join back the call. I asked them about it and they basically told me that they felt they needed to pick either me or M and freeze the other one out because me and M didn\\'t match well, and they had picked M. I have talked to these people for 4 years, and have opened up about everything wrong in my life to them, and they have to me as well. I feel extremely betrayed and confused since I don\\'t know what to do with my life anymore. That group of friends was my entire life, and without it I feel really lost. I still feel like I was in the right and M was being an asshole, but I want to hear from you guys to know if I actually am wrong.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': 'Hey everyone, you\\'ve probably noticed that we\\'re using contest mode in the threads today.\\n\\nWe get a lot of complaints about the way that people vote here. \"I was downvoted!\" They cry, \"Your rules say not to downvote!\" \\n\\nAnd those of us who know *anything* about Reddit know that Reddit has a hive-mind behavior with voting. Enabling contest mode was our way of trying to balance things out and put an end to these complaints. \\n\\nRight now posts are set to stop being in contest mode after 24 hours, which is when flair goes up on posts and the community has decided if the OP is the asshole or not. \\n\\nWe think that contest mode makes a lot of sense in this subreddit because of how this subreddit works. Is it not a contest to get that top comment that will determine the post\\'s flair and to get a point toward one\\'s user flair?\\n\\nDo you hate this? Why do you hate this? Do you think this is a good idea? Do you think the timeframe should be shorter, if so how long? Is there an alternative solution to the issue that you think would be better? Explain the reasoning behind your opinion. ',\n",

       "  'link_flair_text': '',\n",
       "  'selftext': 'My best friend has seen me through so much and I’ve been there for him as much as he allows anyone to be. Except the difference being I’ve grown and matured through my experiences and am working on bettering myself. Im no where near done or perfect but I keep trying. He on the other hands keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.  Never listening to anyone about how to make some changes to prevent the system from repeating. He refuses to make changes because it doesn’t stick. He’d rather ignore all the issues. \\n\\nHe’s started dating again, which is great. He wants to build a family and be in a relationship. He’s wanted this for a while now but the last dozen girls he dated have been mentally unstable or he’s fucked with their heads too much. Me and his other best friend have talked to him about his dating patterns and his behaviours but it doesn’t faze him. \\n\\nI’m at a point that I don’t want to talk to my best friend about his dating life anymore. I’m fed up with it.  He ignores all advice and jumps head first in with girls before they even have their first date. Then gets hurt when they don’t feel the same. Or when they ghost. Or when they turn out to be mentally unstable because they jumped in just as he did and hurt him. Or he hurts them. \\n\\nI’m tired of trying to talk to him and talk him down from his major depressive episodes when they don’t work out. I get wanting a relationship and a family. He’s just doing clingy and cringe worthy things that he didn’t used to do when he was younger. It’s like he’s getting more desperate and less open to any advice or common sense. He is a good guy and a great friend when he’s not so focused on thinking with his male member. \\n\\nSo I’ve kind of been avoiding him some, he’s starting to notice. It’s honestly because his actions dating and changes to his personality to fit each new girl. That I’ve stopped caring about the girls names or information about them because they come and go so frequently. That he changes or cancels plans made in advance to spend time with the new girls who only last 1-5 dates or at most 3 months. \\n\\nMy last straw was talking him down from tears three nights ago because this girl who he thought was amazing didn’t like the fact that he had dated a friend of hers. She found out after their date and he didn’t see the issue but did some super cringe worthy things to get her to stay and date him. Then I find out today he’s already moved on to a new girl who’s about to have date number three with him in a time span of last night to tonight. \\n\\nI know how this is going to end. I just don’t want to be involved. I want no part of this shit show and hope I’m wrong but given his track record and the behavior the both display I’m betting this ends about the same as his last one or worse. It’s shitty seeing him hurt but not making changes to stop the cycle. \\n\\nSo AITA for limiting my time with my best friend over his dating habits? \\n\\n*edits: spelling/auto-correct fixes ',\n",

S then blocked me preventing me from apologising sometime later i get a message from P about what F said and he called me an \"attention seeking whore\" and blocked me as well further preventing me from apologising and trying to make amends. so at this point im having to talk to them through P. i write up an apology and have him send it to them and well they took its not so well calling it a \"mediocre apology\" and pretty much undermining the whole thing  i sent another thing about how i didnt know what to say and i know that my actions cost me a valuable friendship\\n\\nover the course from then till now i tried my hardest to make amends for what i did from where i was at to no avail\\n\\ncut to today where i mention to P that i OD two days ago and got out today. he mentioned it to F and S and they did not take it well at all. saying \\n\\nF:\"kinda dumb isn\\'t he\"\\n\\n \"and yea your right i dont care\"\\n\\n S: \"likewise\"\\n\\nF to P \"and if he keeps seeking attention through you i\\'ll block you \\n\\nF to P \"hell, the only person you\\'re \"helping\" is the person that is using you for his own benefits\"\\n\\nF \" that\\'s not what \"friends\" do  \\n\\nkeep in mind the only things i\\'ve done have talked about how i\\'m feeling  and those three other moments (these are the only \"bad\" things that i can think of)\\n\\nS \" we dont need help with out rational decision to not be pushovers and dick riders... i\\'ll leave it at that\"\\n\\ni sent i final message about how i wish that i could prevent what i did with all my heart and that i wanted to move past that and make amends for what i did and have things go back to the way they were. plus i will not be angry at them or resentful.\\n\\nP sent me a message back saying that they neither want to talk to me or about me i anyway and i\\'ve not had anything back since \\n\\ntl;dr lashed out three time to close friends that i cherished and now i can\\'t even try to make amends with they cause they want nothing to do with me at all ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ok, so actually this isn’t something that happened to me but it happened to my sister(I know this is am I the asshole, but i really want to know who is/ are the asshole/s according to you guys). So she makes part in a group that goes to competitions and stuff. My cousin ALSO made part of this, but they kicked him out because he started dating a random girl from that group that another guy really wanted to ask out. It’s a group that involves A LOT of studying and my sister normally asked questions to him but after he was kicked, her friends she shouldn’t talk about anything from the group after that. \\n\\nMy sister really trusted him, they had this brother and sister relationship and he was literally THE ONLY ONE from my dads side of things that talked to her (My dads family is all fighting and we basically never see each other because of this) so she treasured that friendship a lot. \\n\\nShe spends multiple hours studying for this, but, one day, she had some questions about somethings and decided to ask him because of how much she trusted him. She sent him an audio asking some stuff and begging him to not let the team know she asked. Not only he made the coaches know, he sent them the audio. On the day of the next group reunion, they forced everyone to sit down and listen to it, basically exposing her.\\n\\nAfter that my sister left and arrived home, Crying so hard because of how ashamed and betrayed she felt. I feel really bad that this happened to her but I don’t know who is the asshole. Is it my cousin for betraying her? Is it the coaches for exposing her to everyone? Is it her for doing something she was asked not to do? Or is it her friends for trying to control her way of studying? \\n\\nTL;DR : The group my sister makes part of asked her to not ask my cousin any questions, she asked him, he sent the audio where she asked it to the coaches of this group and they expose her to the whole group.\\n\\nEdit 1: I just noticed how the title may sound clickbaity... sorry about that. (I tried changing it but it isn’t allowing me) \\n\\nEdit 2: So it seems like everything is fine now and im really confused because she was crying her ass off sometime ago and now they’re hanging out like lol, nothing happened. So yeah EHS.',\n",

Some back story, Im a junior at a very small and rural highschool in america, my class is a class of about 94 people and about 400 people in my whole highschool. Im not sure if other schools do this but at my school we have something called snowcoming which is similar to homecoming but instead of football theres a basketball game and theres still a dance. But the thing is nobody makes a big deal out of it most people have a mentallity of \"its just snowcoming\" but at the dance an 18 year old guy proposed to his 16 year old girlfriend for the second time because the first time she spent their whole 9000 dollar budget on a dress so they had no money for the wedding and they broke up so its not a steady relationship. Anyway me and my friends and girlfriend and her friends had a good laugh and cracked a LOT of jokes about this does that make us assholes?\\n\\nEdit: 1. We didn\\'t say anything to either of their faces  all the jokes were made either after the dances in the privacy of our own hang out or over text.\\n\\nEdit 2 . It may be worth noting I am good friends with a girl who is good friends with the girl who got proposed to and she said that the girl who got proposed said, \"I hope you have money saved up because I cant pay for the dress myself\" but idk how true this is because both girls have been known to stretch the truth.\\n\\nEdit 3 . I can add more details about their relationship and first engagement if you guys think it matters.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Let me start this off by saying that this is in the grand scheme of things relatively minor, but it has been really bothering me for some reason. To start off, I work at a local pet food store. We pride ourselves on having high quality foods at good prices that help pets live good lives. Since I'm an employee, I'm entitled to a very generous discount towards food items. \\n\\nWhen our family bought a kitten in September, I tried to explain why I thought it would be better for me to buy healthier food for it. It was agreed upon by everyone in the house that I would buy food for the cat. Some time in early December, my dad and stepmother took a 2 week long trip and I was in charge of taking care of the cat. During this time, I fed the cat mainly one brand of food from the store, just getting different flavors for variety sake. He seemed to love it, and ate it for two weeks straight with zero problems. Zero history of being picky at all.\\n\\nHere is where the problem started. I noticed my stepmother had started feeding the cat Purina, and I brought it up with her. She said that the cat was refusing to eat the food I was bringing home,  which I thought was weird because he seemed to like it when I served it to him. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be confrontational and start an argument, but I got her to agree to let me try out different brands so we wouldn't have to get lower quality foods like Fancy Feast. All was well for a while.\\n\\nOnly now, without telling me at all, she has gone back to getting the Purina. I only knew because I happened to see it in the storage closet next to the litterbox. I can get much better food for the same price, and I pay for it because it's much simpler that way. I want to look out for the health of our cat, and I don't understand why she is taking it into her own hands to feed him with what I view is crap. I have yet to bring this up with her for the second time. AITA for feeling strangely upset about this?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So a little bit of background.\\n\\nI\\'m a 15yr girl who at the age of 14 started having depression/anxiety/self harm thoughts. It first started by my step dad (which had been in my life for 2 yrs now) leaving without me knowing why .at the time my mom didn\\'t tell me anything about it, I just got some vague idea by eavesdropping on conversations that they had a pretty bad fight... \\n\\nAfter that I got send into a mental hospital after my mom found my arms and legs full of cuts. But after that I had another mental breakdown because of my biological father. He died when I was only 6. And that really got into me because my mind just started saying how a bad child I am because I couldn\\'t remember who my dad was, I couldn\\'t even remember how he looks like, or how exactly he died... we got Into a family therapy to talk about it, my mom told the therapist, and me how exactly my father died, she told this story about how he saved us from a bunch of drunk man\\'s and that if it wasn\\'t for him I would\\'ve been raped...\\n\\nBut the thing is, that\\'s now what actually happened... and, at the time I believed it, even going as far as having memories of it, basically, my mom gave me a memory conformity about a trauma.... \\nOf course I got really paranoid because although I couldn\\'t remember what happend, I searched so munch on the Internet because I remember my babysitter telling me about how my dad was on the news... \\n\\nBut after I learned the truth, I also learned another thing my mom didn\\'t told me.... remember earlier how I talked about my step dad? Well the reason they got Into a fight/got a divorce is because he had a child fetish. Not saying he molested or did anything illegal, but he would watch porn with titles like \"daughter banging dad\" \"dad having sex with daughter\" and so on... and I didn\\'t learn from my mom this info no no no... I learned from Joel\\'s (my now new step dad) daugher, which in turn learned from my brother....\\n\\nBasically she told everyone about it, exept me... \\n\\nAnd so after learning that, and after a second visit to the hospital, my mom told the truth about my biological dad, and how he was actually killed because he owned people money and he didn\\'t have any... I was really mad by it, not by the fact of who my dad really was, but the fact that she lied to me while on a therapy visit, with emotions and everything.... I started hating her, doubting her, rebelling against her...\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t talk to her, look at her, and even let her touch me...  \\n\\nHer exude of not telling me/ drifting me away from the truth was that she wanted to protect me, she wanted to not let the outside world hurt me. She was scared that I would be more depressed if I learned the truth... \\n\\nSo my question is, was I in the wrong for being this rude to my mom? I tried the best I could not to let my felling tower over the truth. \\n\\nif you guys need any questions feel free to ask...',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nIve been dating my current girlfriend for seven months. We\\'ve been together long enough that she knows me and my personality.\\n\\nWhat she doesnt know, and what nobody outside of some anonymous people online know, is that I was raped as a boy by my cousin, multiple times, from 8 to 10. My cousin is now estranged and lives far away, but he tortured and abused me for years, and made me act like a girl, wearing womens clothes and putting on makeup before rapibg me. I was only a little kid at the time and couldnt defend myself.\\n\\nI am 27 now. Im strong, tall, and I lift weights regularly. I am very much a \"macho\" type of guy and no one would think that I was a rape victim. I am terrified of people finding out, but for the most part I live my life like everyone else but with a few quirks.\\n\\nFor one I dont allow people to touch me if I dont want them too. I have gotten into fistfights before about men putting their hands on my shoulder. It was just instinct but now ive got control over it and will simply just remove their hands from me and tell them to back off.\\n\\nMy girlfriend knows this about me and though i allow her to touch me I dont let her use her hands sometimes. She sort of leans on me and its fine. Other times I will have this strong urge to be alone. Like we will be watching a movie and ill get up and leave to be alone in my room. I just told her that I need space and she understands. She tells me i should consider seeing a therapist and I dont want too, nor do i have too. Its my decision and i dont want it.\\n\\nMy girlfriend has a gay brother who I cannot stand being around as hes very feminine and stereotypically gay. I feel very uncomfortable around him and avoid him whenever we talk. I also cannot tolerate him touching me and have pushed him away before when he touched my knee. It caused a ruckus but we got over it and I assured my gf that i dont hate gay people i just dont like being around feminine men.\\n\\nMy gfs brother is having a birthday at a gay pride parade and I refuse to go. My gf is upset by this and asks for a reason. I just say I dont want too and its not my scene yet shes been yelling at me about it. I dont feel like i have to provide the reason why i dont want to go if i dont want too and i think she should respect that. She has not though.\\n\\nThe truth is i am extremely uncomfortable looking at these parades, with scantily clad feminine men. Especially with all the stories about young boys dressing up like girls at these things i just think it would remind me of my cousin raping me while i was dressed like a girl. But i dont feel like i have to tell anyone that. AITA?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Soooo.. he didn’t seem to like this and accused me of being ‘sick’ and ‘twisted’ as I’m a ‘daddy’s girl’ just because I have a good relationship with my dad, and am supposedly into incest? Then he goes and asks my sister if I was molested as a child, which I thought was pretty outrageous and not true! So, after this ordeal, I wanted him to accept me as well.. me and he says he can’t do it if I have this ‘incest fetish’ and feels uncomfortable being called daddy due to my relationship with my father. \\n\\nAITA for wanting him to respect my fetish and be angry that he would end our relationship because of this? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In turn making it crash,and things went downhill from there. I never quite forgave him for that but in the end i just stopped caring...up until recently,hes constantly hogging it from his big bro,to get in my game with his friends (or as i call them,absolute fucking douchebags) to harrass me in any ingame way they can,tking and the like,he did it once,thats fine its all good,just dont do it constantly...except he has been,for a few days its constant,and today i just had enough. i pulled him into a party and semi lost my shit,and according to his big brother,who came in midway through this whole shitshow,hes been doing it behind his back (guess his mother is letting him? ill ask him later and say in an edit) which just pisses me off even more,and i just flat out say \"i want to play with your bro! not fucking you mate!\" because his explanation for this was \"him trying to get my attention so we can play\" no idea what his deal is,after i say that,he just says ok and leaves,this happened half an hour ago,AITA?',\n",

She talked about how she wouldn’t date anyone shorter than her, I said I didn’t really see myself dating someone 5 years younger than me and I felt uncomfortable at first about it before I met her in person. The date continued normally and before I dropped her off I told her I wanted to go on another date but throughout the week she was kinda distant so I asked her if she wants to go on another date, she said she thought I didn’t want to date her because she’s 18 and I said when we first matched I was a bit uncomfortable about the idea of dating a 18 year old but once I got to know her. Her age didn’t matter to me but then she told me she’s already talking to someone else. I was like ok cool whatever. \\n\\n      We stayed as friends. We would message each other everyday. She would sometimes joke about me not dating at 18 year old, I just brushed it off. At one point, we talked about potentially dating each other again but we mutually agreed to stay as friends. \\n\\n       A week passed, I met another girl on tinder who’s 18, we just hit it off from the start, we messaged each other for about 2 weeks, we flirted quite a bit. We planned to go on our first date on a Sunday. She messaged me on Wednesday night asking if I want to eat somewhere with her. I said sure, we met at In n Out and we had great time together. We finished eating and we listened to music in her car then things escalated and had sex. \\n\\n      I told my friend what happen, she pretty much said congrats on the sex and stuff. I told her that she’s 18 too and said “OH GOD” “I HATE YOU” not sure if she was joking or not I said “I understand” she replied saying “lmao I guess”. I told her “idk why but I felt like I should tell you for some reason” then she said “lmao it’s cool” \\n\\n     I then told her that she changed my perspective on dating someone younger. After that she said “alright cool have fun” and stopped talking to me. After this past weekend I asked her why she stopped talking to me and she told me it was fucked up on my part that I wouldn’t date a 18 year old (referring to our first date) then go on to have sex with a 18 year old.

She would occasionally come to our house to watch the kids but most of the time we dropped them off at her home.\\n\\nAt the time of our childcare arrangement we spoke about all the normal stuff i.e. payment, drop off, and also tax reporting as this isn't my first go around. When you've paid for childcare expenses in the past they add up quick. We just want to utilize the proper tax benefit.\\n\\nAbout 2 months ago she cancelled with a two week notice (better than none) and we have not used her since. \\n\\nWhile preparing taxes we requested the proper tax forms that she should produce upon request. Her response was that she hadn't kept track all year (we have) and that she does not feel comfortable giving us her SSN as this is how we report to the IRS if they do not have an EIN.\\n\\nMy wife was the one who made the request and let me know what our previous provider said. \\n\\nI then contacted the previous provider and let her know that my wife and I; through our taxes will report her for her lack of due diligence as well the income she made from us. (We are required to report our childcare benefit differently due to her refusal to identify)\\n\\nMy wife is embarrassed I'm her husband now.\\n\\nOn mobile so please forgive formatting or whatever else is wrong.\\n\\n\\nAlso I have not posted much so I don't know what I'm doing.\\n\\nEdit: this provider watched our kids at our house approximately 4 times. The other days she watched the kids at her house when we dropped them off.

I had just gotten out of a ‘thing’ with a girl a couple days back when my father (who had cancer in his neck) died after a tumor ruptured his artery. I was bummed out enough and losing a parent threw me in a ditch. I tried to get back to my regular schedule ASAP so I can move on a little quicker. In the days after the passing of my father, she attempted to come back into my life. Me, being in a weak state of mind, took her back without asking any questions. It wasn’t until things went to shit again in March of 2017 when I realized that she milked the whole ‘loss of parent’ thing for her own gain (i.e. a reason to come back, such as ‘feeling bad for me’). When I realized what she had done, I felt as if she had trampled the grave of my own father. It made me feel a hate I have never fully felt before. I called her human trash and belittled her for injecting herself into such a sensitive time of my life. I then proceeded to deny her existence and immediately ceased communication with anyone she associated with. While it’s been years now and I don’t feel nearly as angry as before, I refuse to work, speak, look, or even be in the same room as her. Did I overreact? Or was  my own judgement correct?',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo basically, I live with 4-5 other roommates, and naturally with that, the common areas are not going to be spotless. We have a kitchen cleaning rotation system where one person is responsible for cleaning it that week. Whenever it’s my turn to clean, if I see a spill on the floor or crumbs on the ground, I clean it without complaining because it’s already my turn to clean and - some weeks I don’t have to do anything extra and some weeks it’s constantly a mess but it evens out. Recently, we had a leak and the whole week I was cleaning spills on the floor but I didn’t realize we had a leak I just assumed someone kept tracking water in because its so rainy lately. I am also the only one who has ever vacuumed the floors ever since moving because I have athsma but again, I don’t complain I just do it despite telling them it bothers my athsma when there is dirt on the floor and asking them to add vacuuming to their cleaning list and getting dismissed. \\n\\nWhenever it’s any of my roommates turns to clean that week, they constantly complain if there is any extra cleaning they have to do their week beyond the minimum we agreed upon even if it is due to an accident even if it was something someone didn’t notice or was in too much of a hurry to notice and planned on coming back to clean it up later that day or was no one’s fault. They are also really weird about the things they complain about. Like it’s ok for them to never vacuum and have filthy floors and crumbs all over the countertops and leave dishes in the sink for days or on the stove for days without rinsing the food off of it, which bothers the hell out of me because I don’t want mice or bugs, and I am constantly wiping it down even if it’s not my turn to clean,  but god forbid there is some water on the countertop or a footprint on the floor they go ballistic in the text because part of the cleaning duties is to mop the floor and wipe the counters down. Literally one time my coffee machine leaked after I left for the day and I didn’t know, I get this angry text from my roommate whose turn it was to clean that week saying ever since I moved in the kitchen has been a disaster and it was a horrid mess and it was the messiest she has ever seen and she demanded I clean it because she had so much anxiety and she made it seem so dramatic, so I ran home from class because I thought maybe my pot exploded....literally it was just a small puddle that took me 2 seconds to clean up that could have easily waited until I got home. And once I literally got lectured for not recycling well enough thus “forcing” my roommate took it upon herself to dig through the trash and pick out some plastic I threw away....like seriously just leave it wtf earth will not die from one plastic container I forgot to recycle don’t nag me about something you chose to do. \\n\\nThis week it wasn’t my turn to clean so I see my roommate in the living room and I walk into the kitchen and see a puddle again and my roommate stops me and tells me there is a leak and she called the apartment to fix it. So seeing it’s not my turn to clean up this week and also now knowing it’s a leak and there is no point in mopping just for it to get wet again 3 seconds later, I leave it. Soon afterwards, we get an angry group text from my roommate (whose turn it wasn’t even for cleaning that week) acting like a martyr for cleaning the puddle and lecturing us for not caring about the common areas at all and how she is the only one who ever does anything. Normally, I just try to appease her and just be like nbd I got it next time, but I think I was just fed up because I just yet again vacuumed the entire common area and wiped all the crumbs off the counters without complaining plus it’s a leak so it’s just going to come back am I supposed to sit around mopping the floor all day so I kind of told her off. I went off about how I clean the common areas all the time even when it’s not my turn to clean and I never say anything because it literally takes me 5 minutes so for her to nag us about this damn puddle that is just going to come back in a few seconds is just beyond petty and I suggested that maybe whoever’s turn it is to clean that week should take care of it if it gets too bad like I have been doing without complaining for the last week. She then responded by saying something along the lines of “or how about we all help out like we are supposed to” and it being extra work and “what does vacuuming the common area have to do with anything” and Seemed kind of upset that I was being dismissive of her and honestly I don’t even know she said some other annoying stuff so I just responded with a simple “whatever” which made her even more upset.  all I can tell you is it just felt good to finally talk back to her for once because she is always nagging about every little thing that bothers her. I feel kind of bad though so if I am being an asshole I guess I should apologize for it. AITA?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Also I’ve only ever known her over the internet, but we’ve FaceTimed a few times)\\n\\nShe’s been depressed for the two years I’ve known her, and I’ve been having a few problems myself, but I’ve always been open to help her. Especially since she had been going though heartbreak, since the person she loved suddenly ghosted her, but before New Year’s Eve, she told me that she want to say something that might be very rude, and me being willing to always listen to her, I agreed that she could tell me anything. \\n\\nShe then told me that “I’ve been such a fucking bitch about (her ex?),” and that “she knows I’m sick about hearing about her”, (which is true but I’ve always tried to give support and advice anyway.) And that “that because of that, it’s why she goes to (over person) for help as well, “ and that she still “has a grudge from August” (I don’t remember what I did that month, sorry) “and my replies on get help when she talks about sex as if she’s  a sex freak” (she always talks about how horny she is, which makes me uncomfortable but I only ever told her to get help with her anger issues) but she then told me she’s sorry and that she’s been kind of a cunt. \\n\\nI then told her if she doesn’t want my help she should stop asking for it. She said she understood but I mean a lot to her and that she doesn’t wanna whine and complain all the time and that (other person) is okay with it but she’s worried about me. \\n\\nI haven’t talked to her since then, because I’m not comfortable talking with her anymore, and now I just really need closure about am I the asshole?

       "  'selftext': \"To start off, I am a 19 y/o female and my brother is a 24 y/o male. He's lived with my dad (59) and my other brother (27) for around a year and a half now. Let me preface this by saying I by no means hate my brother: I just can't stand living with him, nor can I tolerate a number of his behaviours. Ever since he moved in with us, life at home just hasn't been as good. He lives in the converted attic/loft, which is directly above mine and my dads room, and is rarely not making noise, either by shouting and otherwise being verbally loud (he's a 'gamer'), banging and smashing furniture because he died or something, or walking around (the creeky af floors) till past midnight. He hoards dirty plates and glasses in his room for days at a time and leaves said mess in the sink for someone else to clean up (which personally is repulsive and as someone with a mild germ issue, this stresses me out). He's very anti-social so doesn't really spend time with us, cannot be disagreed with without an argument ensuing, smokes weed 'out of the window' - not that it smells like it - which is an annoyance not only because it smells, but because its illegal. He's also very aggressive at times. I mentioned about the banging when he games - well, that's the tip of the iceberg. In pain? Hit something. Internet cuts out? Hit something. There's no milk? Hit something. Any mild/moderate inconvenience? Hit something. Including people. On my 19th birthday, he threw a full bottle at my bed, ripping open my ear, and then punched me in the face. When we got home, he had to be restrained by my dad and boyfriend multiple times to prevent him assaulting me a third time, and even spat at me. He threatened to kill me when I said I was going to phone the police. He tried to defend himself by saying I provoke people. Right.\\n\\nSo, as you can tell, he's not an ideal person to be around. And my dad knows this. But he does little to nothing. When he moved in with us, he told me that things would change. His anger problem would be addressed, his basic inability to function like a normal adult wouldn't be tolerated, etc. Of course these turned out to be just words. My dad feels as though his hands are tied, and in a way, I get it. He doesn't want to have to kick out - or even threaten to kick out - his son. But the problem is, he's going to have to end up choosing between the two of us, because I can't tolerate it. Every day there is another thing I have to bring to my dads attention, and he's no longer interested in hearing it and tells me to give it a rest. He says I'm being unfair and that there's nothing he can do. Am I an asshole for pursuing it? I have to live here too. In fact, I've lived with my dad since I was 12, and only continue to live here as I'm a student and can't afford to move out. To be honest with you, I'm scared of my brother 70% of the time, and don't feel safe or comfortable in my own home, which makes me really sad. Am I overreacting? What should I do?\\n\\nEdit: to those of you telling me to move out and get my own place, I hear you, and I wish I could. But I can’t afford it at all. I’m a university student in the UK. I promise you, I’ve looked into it, and it just isn’t an option until I graduate.\\nAlso let me make it clear I AM NOT ASKING MY\\nDAD TO KICK HIM OUT, but rather for him to tell my brother that he needs to start respecting the other people in the household and stop making it unpleasant for them (not just me).\\n\\nTL/DR: my elder brother is loud, messy and aggressive, and I want my dad to act on it.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I powerlift competitively(relatively new at it). A few weeks ago, I began taking tips (that I didn’t ask for) from some older guys at the gym. These guys are strong and I definitely believe they know their stuff. However, the old school of powerlifting and the new school of powerlifting have a few different opinions I’ve found to be basically unanimous. The new school believes more in recovery and science based periodization (basically how you schedule your training to increase strength) , while the old school generally just believes in hammering the weights basically any time you can. I told one of the guys I didn’t believe in that and he basically won’t talk to me any more. To make a long story short, we were benching (for me) very heavy every 6 days or so, and one day I basically could feel that something was gonna go wrong. I told him that I didn’t want to do things his way any more and that I was “shot”. That night at work I subluxated my shoulder, an injury commonly accredited to overuse.  The other guy, I had him look at my meet (competition) preparations to see if anything looked good or needed improving, etc. I just wanted him to give me an opinion on it- instead of that, he wrote out 14 weeks of programming for me that I absolutely did not ask for. When I (very respectfully) declined to work his way,  he got upset and wrote a long ass post on Facebook about “kids that don’t know what they’re talking about” and how he will now watch me fail. He never mentioned my name, but it was very clearly aimed at me. I even offered to pay him for the time he took out of his life for the programming I didn’t ask for, because I understand that it was a very nice thing to do and he did not have to do it, even though I didn’t ask him to. He, too, no longer speaks to me. So , am I the asshole? ',\n",

A few days ago I walked in slightly late and learned we had a substitute for the lesson, so I knew this lesson was just gonna be shit anyway but I went with it. Literally the second I sat down in my place I was thrown into this vicious argument between K and this blonde girl (B), one of the girls B sat next to had told K that her boyfriend wasn\\'t a real guy, obviously looking for a reaction out of her. As I started to do some of my work and that\\'s when the conversation shifted. B decided to express her belief that being gay was a choice, which was when it became extremely apparent to me that she was looking for a reaction but K was fucking fed up with Bs shit as she had been basically harassing her in those lessons for several weeks so she didn\\'t back down. It was right about this time that one of her friends (L) sat down next to her and started rambling about how his opinion was fact and that i was pretending that I didn\\'t choose to be gay. Now that was when I made the foolish choice of making the joke that L chose to be black as Michael Jackson proved you can change your skin colour, this was very obviously a joke and I don\\'t see how anyone could derive racism from it but I still probably wouldn\\'t have said anything in hindsight anyway. After I said this B fucking accused me of being racist and yelled out that K believed being gay was a mental illness, which was very fucking obviously a lie, and that was just the fucking final straw for me at that point, I fucking hate her and I don\\'t really have the patience to have a conversation with her but to tell me that something I\\'ve struggled with for years is a FUCKING CHOICE is something I just won\\'t stand for. So I cleared my voice to get her attention and said \"if it is a choice then choose to be a lesbian you fucking bint\", I don\\'t regret saying it because it seems to have made her think twice before talking to us again and her mates don\\'t approach any of us, but I think I over reacted and need outside opinion on whether I\\'m the asshole here\\n\\nTL;DR AITA for calling someone a bint when they repeatedly told me that being gay was a choice\\n\\nEdit: for all the lovely Americans out there, bint is just British slang for whore/bitch.',\n",

After a minute of the gate not taking the code I pull forward to see if the person waiting can get it to open. Of course, they do. I loop around and follow them in. Then this person decides to stop, and block the gate. Not allowing me forward. I honk once kind of curious as to what was happening. No response.. i hold the horn down until she gets out, ( I should mention at this point I called the police for some one I don\\'t know blocking my gate.) And she says \"You\\'re trying to sneak in\" when she walks up to my window. I simply told her I called the cops and rolled up my window. She pulls forward after someone else pulls up and she relents and moves in.. she then decides to try and follow me home. I pull over and wait for the police. She did leave and circle back to see if she could figure out where I lived. Cops showed up and said they\\'d contact her for her inappropriate behavior. \\n\\nI guess AITA for refusing to tell her I live there? I do live here,  but in my opinion this woman was really trying to get me to respect her authority or some sort of power trip. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TLDR: momma drama, affects my brother’s coming home cuz I didn’t invite some close fam. \\n\\nMy mom was a single parent for most of my childhood. She’s sweet, loving, honest and extremely loyal. \\nShe tends to get caught in the middle of the family fights. Every time something happens, people drag her into it. Since she wants everyone to get along, she always tries to mediate but gets shitted on for getting too involved. It’s caused a lot of incidents where miscommunications have led to her being cast out or shunned. Whoever was beefing would treat us(her kids) as if nothing was going on but wouldn’t invite her to birthday parties and family gatherings where they would eventually shit-talk her and whatnot. Mind you, I always thought we were pretty tight knit, but now i see my mom would always get the shit end of the stick but in these situations. She wouldn’t lash out or react to keep all us kids out of the drama.(Us 2nd gen kids are super close)\\n It’s taken a toll on her and i feel so bad that she’s been taking that type of abuse for so long. She loves our family, but doesn’t acknowledge just how toxic they can be. \\nShe’s coming around and has decided enough is enough, and has started to cut some of that toxicity out of her life. My mom and i are super close so obviously I’m going to side with her. \\nNow, one of my cousins (who is just a bit closer to my brother) was planning my brother’s coming home party with me. His mom is one of the people that my mom has decided to not have anything to do with anymore. I took it upon myself to let my cousin know of the situation. Didn’t give him all the deets of what went down with my mom and his but told him i did not want her there. He understands to some extent cuz he’s seen the mistreatments of my mom, but since i didn’t give all details of the situation involving his mom, I was scolded for “making this all about my mom and not about my brother that’s coming home.” I agree to an extent, but also don’t want to give my mom anymore shit to deal with now that she’s choosing to give herself a break from the BS. \\nMy cousin’s decided to not attend anymore and is pretty much telling me I’m picking sides instead of trying to keep things neutral for my brother’s sake. Idk, I feel bad cuz we’re all affected but I’m more concerned about my mom’s well being.',\n",

It was slightly on and off because we would butt heads and not back down. But we always went back with open arms because when we were good, we were so good! G starts dating someone and she chooses that relationship over our friendship, for a solid 9 months, she doesn't talk to me at all. They break up, she reaches out and I say she can write me an email explaining. I, of course, let her back in. And at this point, I'm just...so excited to have the chance with my friend again and she blames herself for every struggle that we had and in a way, she was right, she abandoned me when I was at a very low point. She would shove me aside if I was happy and she wasn't.\\nBut I'm not perfect, I was a shit sometimes too. I wouldn't hold back that her partner was being manipulative and I loved her so much - but never more than a friend. But she knew me, she knew all parts of me and when I said that my obsession with wanting to have a close friend + my deep care for her/crush (we had established previously in our relationship that for me, crushing is more about a friendship relationship than a romantic one. Simply because friendship is what I desire most) but when she read that text, she vanished for a week and I sent another message asking her to respond... And she said that she felt weird and different and didn't want to date anyone, totally disregarding EVERYTHING she knew about me and the fact that I'm happily seeing someone lol and I flat out was like, I thought you knew me better, I thought you knew me, we should just break this off now if what I said has made you feel so off and you can't understand what I'm saying now  And she has not said a single thing to me since. It's been weeks, I'm still hurt. \\n\\nSo, my snapping at her, am I the asshole that deserves the ghosting? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What decisions we make directly affect how guests can utilize the public space and ensure thier safety while enjoying the outdoors.\\n\\nThere are 3 leadership roles here, our hill captain (runs the entire patrol for the day) 2 side captains (mountain is split into 2 sections, so they are in charge of the crew for thier side) and then the line patroller who are in charge of closing trails, maintenance, etc.\\n\\nOur side captain suffered an injury and will be out for the remainder of the season, so a newer patroller (the female in question) was promoted and given the chance to lead. She is a paramedic (however she teaches EMT\\'s more than she works in a rig so I\\'ve noticed her practical skills aren\\'t as sharp as they should be) and she is about 2x my age. I however have spent 9 years working here as a patroller so I know how things flow,  what to do and when (basically have 7 more years of practical experience at this mountain than she does).\\n\\nShe showed up late for our shift so I took it upon myself to make sure we could properly open the mountain for guests as it had been more than 30 minutes past the proper opening time and our side of the mountain was still partially closed with crowds growing at the base. I delegated our other patrollers on what needed to be completed (trail sweeps, hang bamboo, basic ski patrol stuff) and sent them off to go get the mountain open and lessen the chance of a major accident.\\n\\nShe finally arrived at the patrol shack almost 45 minutes late and questioned where everyone was. I told her what had happened and that we were getting pressed to open more terrain because it was becoming a safety hazard and she blew a gasket. Saying things like \"I don\\'t take orders from you.\" \"You\\'re not my boss.\" \"I was given this position not you.\" Etc. Etc.\\n\\nI tried to explain myself and state that things were not safe. Yet she continued down the road of anger. At lunch time our hill captain pulled me off the hill to have a chat because of how upset she was. I explained my side of the story and then she barged in trying to take over the conversation. The hill captain then took her side  because I was never able to properly explain myself. As a result he decided I was in the wrong because he was the one that put her in charge. He told me to pack my gear and head home.\\n\\nEdit: since people what to know what I said in response.\\n\\nI basically said The mountain wasn\\'t safe when she arrived and that I sent patrollers out to get things done. \\nThis then prompted her to get upset because it\\'s technically her job and she didn\\'t k ow where anyone was and what was being done.\\n\\nI told her who was where and what was done in a very polite manner, because I could tell she was getting salty.\\n\\nWhich then prompted the \"I don\\'t take orders from you\" to which I stated that \"I wasn\\'t asking you to. However you were more than 45 minutes late and I felt as though it was unfair for our guests and the patrollers who showed up ready to work.\"\\n\\nThen she replied with \"you\\'re not my boss\" and I said I didn\\'t say that I was. I then said \"we waited for you for half an hour, there was no radio call telling us you were here,  or even a text saying you\\'d be late. So I decided that 30 minutes was long enough to wait, so I sent them.\"\\n\\nTo which was her final reply saying she was given the position not me.',\n",

I lived in St.Louis and was 16 years old. I worked down on center stage, but on that particular day I was sent to the first floor to test a new exhibit. While he got prepared I was told to go out on the floor. I am not really that great at social situations so I tried to avoid people as much as I could. Encouraged to help where I could, I saw an amazing creation somebody had made (There was an air tunnel where the ball would go through a series of pipes and end up at the end. ) This kid had created an open version where it would shoot from one pipe to another in open air. I was legitimately impressed but saw one flaw. The ball kept getting caught on a pipe and fall. Seeing this kid was struggling, and being an anti-social I went to fix it. Then the mother saw me. And holy shit I got chewed out. She was quiet but SO LOUD at the same time. A lot of people were looking and I had to take it because ; again , anti-social. Plus I have a past of bursting into tears at the smallest things so I was focusing on not embarrassing myself. She said things like \"You should have let my child take care of it!\" and \"You should just go away!\" I was called in a moment later and went on with my day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR : Fixed a project and got chewed out',\n",

I was stressed and uncomfortable with that, what if they called her saying stupid sexual shit? I talked to them about the fact that I tought that was \"too mutch\" for the joke. While I was talking to them about that, one of them decides to call my mom IN FRONT OF ME when i clearly said i was uncomfortable with that. Out of frustration, (I was so frustrated that i didin\\'t think right for a second) I took my freind\\'s phone that was calling my mom and slammed it on the table that was the last straw. It wasn\\'t broken but it chipped 1 or 2 mm of the corner\\'s alluminium. And I said to them: \"next time someone calls my mom, I will break your phone by slamming it into the ground\" so i would be sure that they woudn\\'t do it again. I think I overreacted a bit here but i still felt like it was the last straw and i had taken too mutch. \\n\\nIt has been 1 week since this happened, and me and my freinds are cool.

I usually work 5 hours part time at a warehouse job but last Friday I decided to work 7 hours. I didn't tell my manager because he was on the other side of the building and I figured that I could get more work done if I just stayed at my location instead of wasting time to walk over and let him know. \\n\\nToday I got called in by my manager today and he said that I should have let him know that I would be working extra hours. We have a labor card and on it I basically put down that I worked 5 straight hours without a break. I found out that there is a labor law that requires companies to give a 15 minute break and a 30 minute break for employees that work 7+ hours. I did not take the 30 minute break because I had lost track of time and opted not to take it. I remember him mentioning something like this but it slipped my mind. It was my mistake and I didn't think that it would blow up like it has. He let me know that there is a company wide process of trying to correct my mistake and that they could be potentially sued in labor court. He told me that he could potentially lose his job because people are going to think that he didn't give me the 30 minute break. The whole day, I've been feeling terrible I really feel like I messed up.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think is going to happen? Is there a way that I can fix this such as e-mailing HR to say that I made the mistake.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I pretty much couldn\\'t focus on anything else so I took the rest of the week off to have a self pity party. That wasn\\'t working so I just decided screw it, I\\'m going to drive 7 hours to see Tammy and just tell her how I was feeling. I texted her on the way and she said she was happy I was coming. I really wanted to address all the very good questions you good people had brought up in my post from Tuesday. \\n\\nSo I got there and we basically hugged hello and I have to admit I was very happy to see her. What was so fucking weird is it was obvious Gregory was living in her place now. I don\\'t even know why I hadn\\'t even thought about this but he\\'s a pretty messy dude so when I saw cereal bowls on the coffee table and socks on the floor (shit that used to drive me up the wall)...I was like wow...this is real. Thank god Greg wasn\\'t there and Tammy apologized that she just didn\\'t feel good enough to clean up before she heard I was coming. \\n\\nSo our conversation basically centered around what happened and why she never told me. At first she was kind of talking around it to spare my feelings and I got sort of frustrated with her and told her to please just tell me what happened. So it turns out they went out as a group right after I gave her Greg\\'s number and they just had an immediate attraction. They said that for the first few times they hung out it was all just reminiscing about our college days and never mentioned the attraction. I guess about two weeks of hanging out they kissed for the first time and she was so pissed at herself she blocked his number and didn\\'t see him for almost a month. I guess she got lonely again, they ran into each other and admitted they had real feelings. She said she texted me and told me she wanted to talk about it right after they agreed to start dating (I found this out on my own on Tuesday after going through my texts, but since I was so busy I wasn\\'t very nice to her) but she knew I was busy and really wavered on interrupting the most important time in my professional career vs telling me some very hard to swallow news. She said rightly or wrongly she decided to tell me in person when she saw me again. Fast forward a little bit I guess they so serious they talked about eloping after only two months and were pretty much living together. She said they had a drunken new years even party and just weren\\'t careful and that\\'s when she assumes she got pregnant. She said she knew then that it was an in person conversation she had to have with me, her first free weekend was last weekend. \\n\\n\\nSo I basically responded to all of this by saying I just didn\\'t know how to feel. That in my brain I knew Gregory and I were not compatible but my heart always hoped we\\'d grow up and be able to make it work AND she was my best friend AND I basically hooked them up. And I just don\\'t know how to deal with all this. I know it\\'s over but even seeing his shit on her floor was sort of painful (honestly, that would have been a massive fight between Greg and I, like I said Tammy is much more chill). I told her that I would always love her and always be her friend but an April wedding is probably just too soon to be involved in a wedding party. She said she totally understood. \\n\\n\\nWe talked about the elephant in the room for maybe 20 more minutes but honestly we were just talking in circles, saying the same thing over and over again. So we just sort of moved on to how she was feeling, how work was going, me apparently wearing some sort of man repellent because I can\\'t even hook up on Tinder  and all the other things friends usually talk about.  Tammy is in full blown morning sickness so she must have barfed 15 times in the first two hours of me being there. At first I just let her do her thing...but then I felt really bad because we\\'ve been friends for over 20 years and I\\'m not even helping her. So I went in and helped put her hair in a pony tail and rubbed her back. And that\\'s when it hit me that I would absolutely regret it and never be able to forgive myself if I weren\\'t there for her wedding, pregnancy and having a baby...no matter who she was marrying. \\n\\n\\nWe went to lunch and at that point I told her I was sorry I was being selfish and I would be her maid of honor. She said no way I was being selfish but would never have another maid of honor besides me. It\\'s not going to be the easiest thing in my life but I can\\'t not do it. \\n\\n\\nSo we went back to her apartment and Gregory was home. Suddenly I felt like such an idiot because I couldn\\'t possibly be in their wedding, let alone ever be around the two of them together. That was the most awkward hello I\\'ve ever had in my life (and thank god he\\'d cleaned up because I was just amped up with nerves to scream at him like I would have in the past). We sort of awkwardly sat on their couch not saying much but after a few minutes I just started telling myself again to grow up, don\\'t let my own feelings get in the way of two people who may really belong together. \\n\\n\\nSeeing them in person together is even more saccharine sweet than I thought possible. They are perfect for each other. Gregory is supportive (I don\\'t know how many times I had to claim best friend privilege when she got sick over loving fiancé privilege) and sweet and she\\'s far more tolerant of him than I could ever possibly be. It was still hard for the rest of the evening but I think it will get better with time. I decided again I would be in heir wedding. \\n\\nWe had dinner and I got a hotel because even though I\\'m trying, i\\'m not ready to sleep in the same house as them. Tammy has to work today so i\\'m just hanging out before I see her for lunch than i\\'m going to drive back home.  We have a long, long way to go but I\\'m so glad I came to see her because at the very least we saw each other and talked it out and I\\'m very happy that I\\'m going to be involved in these major life events with her. \\n\\n\\nthank you so much for all the input the other day and thank you for reading all this. \\n\\ntl;dr: my best friend is pregnant and marrying my ex boyfriend. She told me on Sunday, I had an AITA post that blew up on Tuesday and I travelled to see her yesterday to hash it out. Things are uncomfortable but she is and will always be my best friend and I\\'ve decided I\\'m going to be in her wedding. \\n\\n\\nEdit: guys holy shit! This has blown up again. I literally just got home and have over 200\\nInbox notifications. Thank you so much for the gold and silver. I can’t waif to read all this! Thank you so much!\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: I totally passed out last night so I didn\\'t get to participate like I would have. I have to jump in and defend Tammy, maybe no one will see this because it\\'s probably time this fades. Maybe no one will belive me but for all the critisms of her there\\'s a good explanation that can most likely be explained away by me being a bad writer or not wanting this to be a narcissistic novel. For example, I saw someone saying \"Tammy should have called after the first kiss.\" I\\'ve known her for so long to know that she knows I can be very irrational and angry (I alluded to it in the other post but I had to do a year of anger management therapy because I can be like dynamite when I get pissed, I\\'m way better now but she probably has legit ptsd from some of my freak outs) and she figured it was a one time thing so why poke the bear if that makes sense. \\n\\nSecondly, I can\\'t stress enough how busy I was last fall. Not an exaggeration to say I was working 16+ hours a day with maybe a day off every 20-30 days. I was planning a huge event that centered around a true narcissist and he would have me on my phone, texting questions and answers all day long. The last thing I wanted to do in my time off was get on my phone. I can count from that period and I\\'d say it averages 10 to 1 of Tammy texting me (I assume calls were worse) but one stretch I think I counted she texted me 40 times before I texted her back. It\\'s bad timing more than anything because anyone of those may have been when she wanted to tell me. And I definitely appreciate her thoughtfulness of not wanting to spring it on me while I was losing my mind from lack of sleep at work. I agree with her that this was an in person conversation anyways. \\n\\nI know Tammy is just an Internet Sprite to all but one of you (and that is so f-ing tworedditorsonecup thing, I wish I had the energy to do another post) but she is a real person who has been my ride or die since we were 10 and 11. We\\'ve fought, screwed each other over so many times and we\\'ve always forgiven each other because having her in my life is way more important than pining over a guy I spent most of my time frustrated with anyways. Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m still pining and I cried last night over this...but like so many people said, maybe Tam-Tam\\'s best gift to me as a friend was forcing me to get on with shit...maybe 10 years and 40+ breakups and just as many  broken dishes and slammed doors...she was the sign the universe sent to make me move on from a guy who wasn\\'t right for me.

So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about three years now and things have been going great. I really love this girl and honestly she’s one of the best things that ever happened to me she’s really influenced me to become a better person and pushes me to improve myself. We get along great and can spend hours just laughing at the dumbest stuff.\\n\\nAnyways here’s what the problem is. I consider myself to be bi curious but I never actually told my gf this. Recently I was doing my taxes and had to access and old email account. Long story short i left it open and she went through it and found emails from 7 years ago when I was 18 to a guy I had met playing a game online. I’ve never actually done anything with any guy but I did send this guy nudes which she found. \\n\\nThis was a few weeks ago. When she originally confronted me she was upset, which I don’t blame her for at all. I explained the situation and how I felt and was 100% honest with her. I told her I didn’t really have any desire to hook up with guys and that it was just a fantasy/me being curious which was the truth. She seemed to understand and even went as far to say we should have a threesome with another guy and proceeded to tell me about guys she knew who might be interested. I declined. It really just isn’t something that I’m interested in anymore.\\n\\nFast forward to yesterday. We had a great day watched a star is born and had really great sex. She leave last night for a few days to go visit her family (not uncommon as they live a few hours and it’s not really worth it to drive there and back in the same day) Anyways she texts me last night and basically says she doesn’t want to be with me and that she can’t trust me because I’m obviously going to cheat on her with another guy and that we should basically just break up. This basically ends with “YOURE GAY” “YOU LIKE DICK” until I just turned my phone off. This was all over text and she refused to answer my FaceTime as well.\\n\\nHere’s the thing tho she’s actually hooked up with her friend who lives in the same house as us (we rent the upstairs apartment from her parents) and she didn’t tell me about this. I actually found out from her friends ex boyfriend who I become good friends with when he lived here. Even last night she claimed it was only during a threesome which wasn’t true and I had to remind her that I knew the truth from the ex boyfriend. I honestly didn’t care it wasn’t a big to me I didn’t even say anything when they went on vacation together for two weeks a few months ago and slept in the same bed. I trust her.\\n\\nThing is she claims that it’s not the same for girls that all girls do it but because I’m a guy I’m gay af and want to be with guys and that I’m somehow using her. Even tho I’ve never actually done anything with a guy yet she has hooked up multiple times with this friend. To me this is totally hypocritical and borderline sexist.\\n\\nWhat do you think reddit am I the asshole? Is it fair for her to say that she can’t plan a future with me because of this and I’m ultimately going to cheat on her? I know I should of just been honest for the start but she wasn’t honest either and I just didn’t want her to treat me differently as it wasn’t a big deal to me.\\n\\nTLDR; girlfriend found out I’m bi so now that means I’m obviously going to cheat on her sometime in the future so we might as well just break up now.\\n\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I knew from the start that that would be a bad idea, so I refused.  \\n\\nThe other night, however, she tried to debate the topic of racism with me and her viewpoint was really irritating to me. (I won\\'t include what her point of view is, in order to avoid biased responses, but it was quite extreme.) I couldn\\'t help but tell her that I disagreed, and that her opinion was very toxic. She got angry with me, which I accepted, until she threw a personal insult at me (again, I won\\'t get specific, but she mentioned the title of a song I like in an insulting way.) \\n\\nThis is where I think I may have been an asshole: she sent me an apology message saying that she shouldn\\'t have said what she did...which I ignored. \\n\\nThe next day she calls my sister and tells her we got into an argument and that I blocked her number (I didn\\'t.) She also tells my sister that I always respond poorly to arguments, and that she always apologized \"for my benefit\" in past arguments...when we\\'ve never actually argued before!? When I text her, telling her she was never blocked, she replied by saying she\\'s \"extremely mad at me\" but doesn\\'t want to give up on our friendship. Utterly pissed off, I say I do not want to talk to her. She says \"do you not want to be friends? Is it so hard to say you don\\'t want to be friends?\" And so I reply:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to be friends lmao and leave my family alone\" \\n\\nAnd then she replies with the following message: \\n\\n\"Lol awww poor (my name), she couldn\\'t handle being called out on her shit. Is anyone surprised? Nope. Enjoy your shit life. What a waste of my fucking time. Oh and don\\'t forget to remember why you have those abandonment issues. It\\'s because you\\'re a selfish cunt who constantly cuts people off but has the audacity to expect something different in return. I hope that doctor really helps you. I\\'ll be happy to leave your family alone, they have enough on their hands all thanks to you. Good luck. And goodbye.\"\\n\\nThis message was out of line but did I have it coming for ending a fairly deep friendship over ONE argument? For the record, I replied with \"lmao :)\" to her rant and then blocked her, but I have to see this girl at work Friday so would like some guidance on this situation. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I was good friends with this girl (not my GF), let's call her Moraine. So one day, Moraine is with her other friends, and the friends are exactly on good terms with someone which they didn't exactly like. The person was quite bossy at times and annoying. They've been friends for quite some while and create a presentation on how they will tell the person.  Moraine was good friends with this person, up to this while, and agrees with the plan. The very next day, at school they plan to tell her after the period but during the current period, Moraine is in a group with the girl and opens up her google drive. The girl supposedly sees it and she opens it up willingly (REALIZE THAT THEY WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS SO SHE DID NOT HAVE TO SHARE THE DOCUMENT WITH HER) and the girl is **INFURIATED.** Immediately she goes down to the office and snitches on those group of girls. They go down, have an in-school suspension for the rest of the day, and during the conference, that awful, horrible girl wanted to get the *police* *involved.* Luckily, the police were not informed and the rest of the day goes on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am still friends with her, next day flies by and then I find out about this through MILLIONS of messages through Discord and Instagram. She makes multiple bullshit claims and tries to defend herself, I decided to believe her until I got in contact with the girls at school. Apparently, she was BSing me and during the conference its as if she never met them. I am still not on good terms with the girl, but I want the great redditor judgement. Am I The Asshole?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 1: The presentation was a presentation between the girls and Moraine on how they would tell the girl why they did not want to be friends. This was for them only, not to show the girl.\",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\n       Me quoting a link: \"A measles outbreak is rapidly spreading across a Washington county known for choosing not to vaccinate its children, and\\xa0health officials have declared\\xa0a public health emergency.\"\\n\"People choosing not to vaccinate\\xa0have become a global health threat in 2019, the World Health Organization\\xa0reported\\xa0this month. The CDC recognized that the\\xa0number of children who aren\\'t being vaccinated by 24 months old has been\\xa0gradually increasing...\"\\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/01/30/measles-outbreak-washington-anti-vaccine-what-know/2719315002/\\n\\n     Aunt: Oh dear😔\\n\\n     Me continuing to quote same link: The link is very informative.\\n\\n\"Measles is so contagious that 90 percent\\xa0of unvaccinated people who come in contact with an infected person will get the virus, according to the\\xa0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can spread four days before and after symptoms appear.\\xa0\"\\nThe part I can\\'t stress enough... \"Some parents opt not to vaccinate because of the discredited belief vaccines are linked to autism.\\xa0The CDC said\\xa0that there is no link and that there are no ingredients in vaccines that could cause autism.\"\\n\\n      Aunt: Q and I were just talking about that. He said he\\'s researched it and found that also, there\\'s no proof of it and now it puts everyone at risk.\\n\\n    My Husband: I found that instead of saying there\\'s no proof or evidence that vaccines don\\'t cause autism doesn\\'t change people\\'s minds. However there is a bunch of studies that show evidence that vaccines don\\'t cause autism. \\n\\n     Sister in law: I think it is important to point out that this issue has become very polarized and that if doctors were more willing to talk with parents kindly and honestly and be more flexible they would be more people to vaccinate. The truth is that people try to bully others into changing their mind and that never works. There have been children that have died from adverse allergic reactions to vaccines. I personally have not had a good experience with Gardasil. I fainted 2x while getting it and every vaccine I have gotten since gives me a significant allergic reaction. But no doctor has ever cared to document that therefore it is never tracked. \\n\\n     Aunt: Is that the real issue, polarization?\\n\\n     Sister in law: I think so. Everyone is different and responds different. It\\'s not cookie cutter. \\nBut at times people are treated like the response SHOULD  be the same and good riddance if you don\\'t. \\n\\n      Me: What you said was true. However, the bullying only really takes place when having these discussions online with strangers. I personally have never met someone in person that bullied me because of what I thought (outside of highschool).. Please don\\'t take my link as bullying on any level. I quoted the link directly, and provided the link. I simply thought it was important information to pass forward, especially since we have very young kids.\\nA very dangerous illness is now being declared a \"public health emergency\", that is a fact.. that is a very scary thought, especially considering that the vaccines aren\\'t 100%. I just wanted to make sure everyone connected and around my kids are aware of this. As a mother, in my opinion, you can\\'t be too careful\\nIf you feel there may be an allergic reaction possible, and their current Dr sounds dismissive and you don\\'t trust him/her. Getting other options from Drs you like better, could be very beneficial. \\nI am very guilty of self diagnosing, but have found myself quite wrong when talking to multiple different Drs. A professional opinion is a good thing to have when trying to make a well knowledged decision.\\n What works best for you and your family is between you guys. However if the kids aren\\'t getting certain vaccines (or any), it would be common courtesy to discuss that with other parents your kids might be around beforehand... Generally speaking\\n\\n        Sister in law: Oh I was not saying in any way that you were bullying. I was talking about specific instances with doctors and others experiences with certain doctors. I had asked to wait a little bit for H to get her chicken pox shot as a young child and the doctor was very aggressive about it. I understand that schedules and time lines are to some extent important but it is also important to be flexible, especially if your child is still fighting a cold. I have not experienced that with every doctor and our current doctor is not like that because he actually takes his time to be with his patients. At times doctors offices become like assembly lines and anything that is in inconvenient  but might benefit a person gets pushed aside for the bottom line. I am simply saying if doctors were more flexible I think more kids would be vaccinated. I don\\'t believe in throwing the baby out with the bath water but the truth is that a lot are and not just because of the autism debate. But some may feel like they have to say no all together because their specific doctor would not work with them.\\nTo say that Every single vaccine is 100% safe for every person is a completely false statement. If you look at the paper they give you you can see for each vaccine all.the know side effects and contra indications for that vaccine (just like a medication). Every vaccine has different ingredients in it and some are much safer than others. I am not 100% sure but I think gardasil has the highest known death rate side effect of vaccines. If I remember correctly the hib vaccine was one of the safer ones with none to barely any reported deaths and the main side effects were runny nose and swelling. This past time I took h in for a shot was the first time anyone ever asked me if they had a flu or fever in the last day or so. I was really proud of the nurse for doing her due diligence because all of the vaccine papers state that. Just saying it is a risk assessment that ever parent should be informed about. God forbid your kid dies of measles and God forbid your kid dies from a vaccine. I feel for all of the parents no matter what but we all have to live with the decisions we make and every parent should feel confident about their own personal decisions because they will have to live with them. \\n\\n       Me: Exactly. That\\'s why I said \\n\"If the kids aren\\'t getting certain vaccines (or any at all), it would be common courtesy to discuss that with other parents your kids might be playing around beforehand.. Generally speaking.\"\\nIf that is what is best for a family, then so be it. The right thing to do at that point is for them to inform other parents of their decisions that could effect other children.\\n\\n         Sister in law: Yeah but in practicality do you give a list of every vaccine your kid has or has not had on a pay date? And if the other kids are vaccinated then they should be fine.\\nYou do want me to print our kids shot records for you so you can decide if we are aloud to play with you again?\\n\\n         Me: Their vaccines don\\'t spread, and aren\\'t a potential threat\\nEveryone has the right to their feelings and reactions. \\nWe don\\'t have to like how people react, that\\'s part of making a choice, is living with everything that follows.. taking away another person\\'s right to make a decision is not ok.\\nIf my kids have been sick or had a fever I inform the parents before a playdate.. they are the ones taking care of their kids when they are sick. The least I can do is let them prepare or prevent, that\\'s up to the other parent.\\n\\n        Sister in law: Yes but also taking away someone\\'s educated right to which vaccines they choose are best for their family or not is not right. So if you want that list let me know\\n\\n        Me: No one is stopping anyone from making the right decisions for their family, except for the people withholding information that could be a threat...\\nI don\\'t need a list, but I would appreciate to know what vaccines you refuse. What I should be watching out for, or possibilities. I try to catch things early so the boys don\\'t suffer too long \\n\\n        Sister in law: Wait I\\'m confused at what you are saying now. Are you saying you think you should inform other kids parents of sickness when playing together or informing them all the time weather they are vaccinated or not and if so what they have and have not been vaccinated for?\\n\\n      Me: I was using that as an example\\n\\n      Sister in law: Ok so like say in the case of H and M. H has chicken pox vax and M has not gotten yet. Now pretend they are in different families. Are you saying that you think M mom should tell mom friends if he has been exposed to chicken pox or like every one they hang out with say he has not has chicken pox vax. So H has a very small likelyhood of getting chicken pox since she had the shot and for some it is pretty positive she would not so playing with M even if he had full blown chicken pox may not even have any effect on her. Now with things like chicken pox people that choose not to get the vaccine know the risk and are ok with it because let\\'s be honest I had chicken pox as a 2 yr old before there was even a vaccine and it is just an annoyingly itchy virus that runs it\\'s course. But like in the instance of measles that is a much bigger deal because it is a worse virus. But even so parents that have their kids vaccinated shouldn\\'t have to worry about their kids playing with unvaccinated kids because they will not get it, worst case scenario is ur kid is carrying it and gives it to the other kid without the vaccine. But that is on the parent of the kid that chose not to get vaccinated not the parent that got their kid vaccinated. \\n\\n          Me: It\\'s not just to protect my children. It communicates with other adults to make sure your kids aren\\'t at risk to something their kids are expose',\n",

After around the 6th week of classes, I noticed how much Colin was in the room and how little to none of his time was spent doing homework or studying. This became very irritating because I had almost no alone time in the room and anytime I would go somewhere or do something with a friend Colin would immediately ask if he was invited. Colin spent the majority of his time in bed or on his computer playing video games and watching YouTube / Twitch.tv.

The night before Colin plans on coming back to campus we talk on our Discord server and catch up on what happened over break and play a couple games together. Colin showed up to the dorm the next day, less than 12 hours since we talked last on our computers and claims that his hard drive \"corrupted\" and wasn\\'t able to launch windows. As soon as he told me that I knew he was lying. Our friend group already knew that his parents were going to take his computer away, as a result of his grades from last semester. At this point, Colin is now trying his hardest to do stuff with me now that he doesn\\'t have a computer to entertain himself, but I just make plans with other people to try to avoid him. Two weeks into the semester Colin goes home to retrieve his \"broken computer\" and \"celebrate his birthday with his family\". Throughout the entire weekend, Colin is on his computer at home playing video games and talking about all the presents he got for his birthday. I was flabbergasted when he came back to campus with not only his computer but a brand new console.

Now she’s emailing me since I blocked her on SM and my phone hounding me about this FA tax info. She also called other relatives of mines telling them to tell me to give her my FA info for her taxes. From what I learned is that she doesn’t even need my FA to file her taxes. It just gives her a good deduction so she can get more $$. Haven’t responded to any of her emails. Don’t think I plan to either. \\n\\n\\n\\nFor people that don’t know what The N in mom is, it’s stands for Narcissistic. \\n\\nEdit: She didn’t have to pay for anything since I got a pell grant. She put down her info for me get the FA I needed but she also got a hefty amount of money from my refunds. I’d say we’re even. \\nEdit 2: Now if it’s required by law for her to put that down then I will just have to swallow my pride and give her what she wants.  No need in her going to jail or getting in trouble with the IRS. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'AITA For making someone drive in the snow when they refused to come on the day and a half it was safe to drive?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy ex and now \"friend\" / sort of like a brother has a standing agreement he take me to medical appointments that will get me mobile until his car is fixed. I am housebound through a series of illegal things but was going to medical appointements to get proper orthotics and medical shoes, as well as coordinating with doctors to get an electric scooter or home physical therapy to teach me how to walk outside without hurting myself. I cannot open the door to my apartment, it is illegally inaccessible. A week ago he took my keys to let himself in Sunday in the middle of the night to take me to an 8 am appt. He  ended up being snowed in. In the week since, my resident manager asked for the storage key to change locks or something.  I cannot access my mail or give my key to others or even leave my building for medical appointments.  Each day, I looked at the roads and it was too icy for his car. We live in Seattle and no one has snow tires but we are surrounded by hills and the area has 5 snow plows. He is coming from up a steep hill in a wetland area. I repeatedly told him I wasnt concerned about my car, I was concerned about his safety - He said he would drive in unsafe conditions if I chose - the car had slid into another car a year ago on the one day it snowed. There was one day without ice and I had an important appointment to get medical shoes to walk. The woman, whom Ive worked with for 15 - 20 years, is mostly retired and was going to be in another town but rearranged her schedule to work with me that day. Right as he called to come I was informed the appointment might have been cancelled. I spent some time both talking to them to see if it was still available an d that the roads would remain clear, as he had not come in the morning like he said when it was safe.  He grew frustrated with me but said he would come. The woman wanted to go home to care for her mother at 2 pm, but was willing to stay until 4. Her mother has to be 90.  She told me to call her as soon as I knew I wasnt coming. I had to let her know at 3:30. I received a text from my ex saying \"I don\\'t want to talk right now.\" I beat myself up literally all day and cried for the majority of 8 hours, quietly, as I tried to focus on other things. I was consumed with guillt because he had told me he didn\\'t want to come up because of my bullshit attiude in one of the phone calls when I expressed frustration that he had not come up when it was safer like he\\'d promised, adn that I wanted only to be sure it was still safe.  I did tell him I wasnt sure I wanted to see him again because this is an ongoing pattern. I did not raise my voice or call him names. Im on a medication that helps.  At midnight, after I cleaned the house out of guilt, he told me he was coming today at 8 am to give me my keys and credit card and shower chair, and possibly take me to an appointment for frostbite and make sure I had some food for the coming snowstorm. I let him know when it would snow. I stayed up much later decrompressing but woke up early and he didn\\'t show. I finalyl got someone in his commune (yes, he lives in  a commune) to check on him at 11:30 am. The snow was going to start at 2. I was able to see that a walk in clinic might see me at 12:30 but no later.  He said, \"No problem, thats an hour away.\" He didnt leave until almost 12 so  told him to go the toll roads and found another walk in clinic to go to.  But while he was driving , it snowed. I texted him that I wasn\\'t sure how to keep him safe and that i\\'d been trying all along but I just didn\\'t know what to do. He showed up at 1 pm and gave me my keys and shower chair and some paper work and said he\\'d take me to the walk in clinic - turns out theres one in my apartment complex, but it has the same name as a national dental clinic so id never looked it up. He then told me it was snowing and he had to leave. AITA for making him come in inclement weather? Sidenote - we have had a toxic relatiobship for years but dated as recently as two years ago and did well. Around the same time I became housebound he became mean, as I tried to work on my own anger. He agrees weeks in advance to take me to things or help me get independent, and then bails because hes sleeping or in a bad mood or hes frustrated with me. Sometimes , like today, he waits until the last minute, and then the chance is gone.  I know Ive been verbally abusive in past, Im just trying to get indepenent enough to end our relationship.  I have no family and am only just making friends in the community ive moved to. The housing situation told me they would make the doors accessible so I could get out the door but changed their mind and I am waiting for section 8 to let me move.   Its just a shitty situation all around. I\\'ve been trying so hard to mend my anger and have told him Im not angry with him when I am just sad at being housebound but he takes my sadness personally. I know I\\'ve been an asshole, but im trying not to be. My eczema breaks out in front of him.  I feel like the nicer I am to him, the meaner he is to me, but I also feel like I deserve it because of how I used to treat him. I had yelled a lot because of our toxicity and when he\\'d lived with me without paying rent or doing chores. I am not a nice person, but I used to be. I am nice to everyone else because I feel so bad about how we get along. I want to say goodbye forever and just be a nice person again.\\n\\nLastly, I did text them while they were driving that the weather was changing and that maybe they should turn around.\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nAITA So this took place a couple of years ago, i believe almost five years. At the time I was 13 and my little brother was 8. But i need to say a couple of things begrote I start the story.\\n\\nFirst of all, I love my little brother, he’s quote an asshole, but you know, all younger siblings are. Second of all, I was, and still am, a really quiet person. I’m very introverted and bad at making friends. I didn’t like confrontation, but what I absolutely hated was injustice.\\n\\nSo it was summer vacation and we were in France on a camping site with a bunch of tents, wooden bungalows and campers. It had a swimming pool and a bunch of playgrounds, one of which just by our bungalow. It was surrounded by think hedges with a small ditch under it (this is important).\\n\\nIt’s the third day and my little brother was plating with his friends with a plastic balk we had brought with us. I didn’t have any friends there and was mostly just wandeling the camping. \\n\\nWhen it’s around 13:00 my mother calls us to get some food and drinks and that we were planning on going somewhere, me and my brother both go. Later in the evening (like 15:00) my brother’s friends have to leave and he comes home. I was already there and when he comes my mother asks where the plastic ball is. He tells her I lost it, even though I hadn’t touched the thing since we arrived. My mother demands I go look for it and can’t come back until I find it. I try to explain to her that I never touched it, but She didn’t care.\\n\\nI go (because i hate confrontation) and go look for this stupid thing, but can’t find it. I could’t go back again (i did once before but mom got angry and Told me to find it) so I sat at the toilet building next to the playground for like 2 hours. I was f’cking angry and as pissed as a 13 year old could possibly be. \\n\\nThen my little brother fonds me and yells at me for not ronding the ball. I was all pent up and slapped him, like full on slap. People were looking but i didn’t care. My brother ends up running home and my dad later berated me for hitting him. So my mom comes to the toilets and helps me find this f’cking ball. We end up finding it at the backside of the playground, in the ditch. Where, mind you, I HADN’T BEEN FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. My mom later apologised and so did my dad and little brother, but I still feel really bad About hitting him, even though he’s 12 now and I’m 17.\\n\\nWas I wrong for hitting him?\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': \"Ok - long story short: in October, I made a friend at work with whom I became infatuated. She is married and there is no possibility of anything happening between us, but that didn't stop me from swooning over her every text message. I did not tell her about these feelings or make any kind of advance since I had no real expectation of being with her, so for the past few months we've been  talking regularly and hanging out on occasion as friends. No big deal.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCut to 2 weeks ago. I had finally come to terms with the fact that this has become a very unhealthy situation for me, and I probably need some time and space from it. I wanted to tell her this in person, but I did not have the courage to look her in the eye and  a) confess my feelings, and b) tell her I need to back away for a bit. So I sent her a text explaining that I'd caught feelings, it had become unhealthy, and I thought she deserved a friend who was in it for the right reasons. So I'd need to back away for a bit. She was gracious, if cold, in her reply: she said she'd had no idea about my feelings, that she hopes she didn't do anything to make them worse, and that she respects my decision. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe haven't spoken much at all since then, and I have gone well out of my way to avoid her at work because I do NOT want to make her feel creeped on or uncomfortable. Any contact we have had has been muted and pretty cold from her end. But, in the time since I sent her the feelings text, I've realized that the way I wrote it likely implied that I only ever became friends with her because I want her. SO, I've spent the day drafting a letter explaining carefully that our friendship - the ACTUAL friendship we'd built over the past months - was not part of some long-term agenda to be with her, and that my feelings are incidental to the friendship. I can't stand her thinking that our whole friendship was a lie, and I've already told her that my hope is for us to be close again someday. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAITA or WIBTA for reaching out to make her to understand that I didn't have bad intentions? Have I forfeited my right to try and explain myself to my friend? \",\n",

At the reception there was a guy there making a complete ass of himself. He was in his young 20\\'s apparently wrestled in college and has just getting into MMA.  He had a few drinks and was a little buzzed but he wasn\\'t stumbling around shitfaced. \\n\\nHe was walking around introducing himself to random people and when they went to shake his hand he would put him in like an arm bar and shit. His girlfriend who was completely humiliated tried to get him to stop and he just told her, \"oh don\\'t worry babe. I am just having a little fun. Stop overreacting.\"\\n\\nEventually he is standing right next to where I am sitting talking to some other guy about how he bets he could kick anyones ass at this party. Now I am a 35 year old dude that used to make a living fighting and still train and coach on the side for fun. So I got a good chuckle out of that and said, \"I\\'ll take you up on that bet.\" I was thinking that someone actually calling his bluff would make him chill out. But he responds with, \"Sounds good, $1000 and your on.\"\\n\\nSo I shake his hand and tell him after the reception is over. \\n\\nThankfully this did calm him down for the rest of the wedding but word did spread so after the wedding there are too many people hyping him up for him to back down. So we go into the small grass park by where the reception was.\\n\\nI put him into a few different holds and then let him go before I finally throw a punch and put him on the ground.\\n\\nAfter this I still make him go pull out the grand and pay me and in a half snarky half real tone I tell him that I hope he learned his lesson.\\n\\nI am kinda torn on how I handled it. Part of me thinks I took advantage of the kid and practically robbed him and the other half of me thinks that he was being an arrogant prick that needed to be knocked down a peg.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We’re just waiting for a better point in our lives but we know it’s going to happen when we are more financially stable and ready. She’s always been there for me and vice versa and she is just plain wonderful. We both wanted a big family taking about having three to four kids when the time comes.\\n\\nHer anatomical issue is resulting from the fact that my gf had Cancer when she was a child and went through multiple rounds of chemo. She has been in remission for over 10 years and while that is not a current threat she was told that she might have some issues with fertility later on in life. These are circumstances I have long been aware of and we have talked about it because I’ve always wanted my own kids and my own family one day. After a long discussion the conclusion we came down to was worst comes to worst we would use a surrogate as I wanted a child from my blood and she initially said she would love the kid to have my DNA. I was relieved and felt more secure that even if we couldn’t have kids together I could still have this option.\\n\\nFlash forward to today’s conflict where she said she’s had a change of heart and would feel weird like she was raising someone else’s child. This was hurtful to hear because we had already discussed this and she knows where I’ve always stood on wanting my own family someday. We spent awhile arguing but couldn’t make a compromise either way. Finally a he asked me if this was a dealbreaker and I told her potentially it was. She said I was the asshole for not recognizing her feelings and seeing how hard this was for her. I feel like I understand it is difficult and she doesn’t understand that this is something I’ve always wanted. I’m trying to straighten it all out myself so I turn to you for judgement reddit, am I being selfish ...AITA here?',\n",

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nHey guys quick story for you guys and obvious question, I recently moved to a new apartment with my girlfriend about a month ago and got a job over here closer to my area. I almost immediately became friends with another coworker named Brandon as we had a lot in common and were both relatively new to the area. \\n\\nI worked there maybe 2 weeks and spent every shift with him as we were stuck doing the same work and were both being trained together. So we got to know each other well. I told him my family was having a cookout for the Super Bowl and that he could come over and that he would meet new people around our age and have fun. He agreed and as soon as the week was up it was Super Bowl weekend at Michelangelo’s Mom’s place. \\n\\nIt’s a big deal every year cause my mom cooks a ton of food and has a ton of people over as well and I took him too it and everything went fine! We had drinks and ate great food and mingled with all the family and friends everyone had invited it was a great night and he even made a few other friends there. \\n\\nUntil the NEXT DAY... \\n\\nI walk into work and the assistant supervisor is giving me a death stare and told me very loudly and promptly to Go to his office. I did so as there were coworkers staring at me and even Brandon went and hid behind the doorway when he said this and I walked into the office and he slammed it behind me. \\n\\n“Take a seat” \\n\\n—— “What’s wrong man?” \\n\\n•••“Listen and listen real fucking good!” Brandon isn’t allowed to smoke or drink AT ALL!” \\n\\n—— *Perplexed* “What do you mean?” \\n\\n•••“He has a rare condition that’s very confusing to understand and explain but pretty much the medicine he has to take for it can hurt him or worse if it mixes with alcohol and the doctors said that he’d be WAY SAFER if he didn’t drink at all! IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?” \\n\\n—— “Yea man I’m sorry he didn’t tell me anything about it. He just asked if we had drinks and asked for a beer..” \\n\\n••• “Well now you know if you hangout with him that he can’t drink, smoke, and sure as fuck not do drugs! IS THAT CLEAR?!” \\n\\n—— “Yes sir” \\n\\n••• “Good! Now get back to work!” \\n\\nI walked out and everyone was staring at me as the company I work for is small and family operated I found out later that Brandon was the owners little cousin and that he isn’t just new to the area but new to the country! And to make things better he (The owner who I haven’t met yet) was on his way to talk to me. \\n\\nGreat! I got fucked on some shit I had no idea about. The whole day everyone looked at me wrong and gave me shit jobs to do. And even kept me an hour after I was suppose to get off to clean up the entire storefront. As well as storage and the entire back of the place. \\n\\nAnd right as I was about to leave the owner shows up and asks to speak with me. I put my shit away as I was cleaning and walked into his office with him. He politely explained what the Assistant Supervisor said but in a little more detail and much more calmly. He said that he didn’t care because I didn’t know but that he wants me to be more careful with him. I said Yes sir and that I was sorry and he nodded towards the door and told me to go home. \\n\\nAlmost immediately after I left the buildings I got a text from Brandon asking me what they said. (he didn’t even apologize) I told him that he didn’t tell me anything about his condition or medicine or anything and that everyone thinks I was intentionally trying to hurt him or worse. And that everyone thinks it’s my fault he had drank. \\n\\nHe then explained that he was sorry and the he just wanted to be cool in front of everyone and fit in. He said that he didn’t have any friends as he was entirely new here and that he let loose way too much and he was sorry. \\n\\nI told him we were cool as long as he kept me up to date with shit and let me know things like that. He agreed and the next day everything went back to normal and we were cool again. \\n\\nWhy I’m posting this is because next weekend is my girlfriends birthday and to celebrate we’re all going clubbing then to a hookah lounge and she thought it would be cool to invite him because everyone whom he had made friends with at the cook out would be attending the celebration and I don’t know if I want him there and I even thought about lying to him and saying we cancelled just so I wouldn’t have to worry about anything and have been scheming about how to do it or even if I should ever since she told me. I’m really at a cross and my girlfriend knows about what happened but still thinks he should come because she doesn’t wanna be an ass and thinks he deserves another chance. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for trying to find a way to get him to not go? Or should I give him another shot? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The told me that it was covered under warranty, and to bring it in. I even have 2 emails from them confirming the appointment, and the warranty coverage. We dropped the car off, and after 2 days they said they could not replicate the noise and for us to come pick it up, which we did. On the drive home from the dealership, the noise came back so I got it on video, put it on youtube, and sent them the link. They saw the video, thanked me for it and said to bring it back now that they confirmed the failure. My wife dropped it off, they supplied her with a loaner, and then right before closing they emailed me saying that it's NOT covered under warranty. \\n\\nI've been going back and forth with the service manager all evening arguing that they should honor the original deal. It's only $253.00 out of pocket for me, but that's not really the point in my opinion. The part is only 86.00 shipped, and I have a full lift in my garage (I restore old cars as a hobby) so I am more than capable of doing the job. \\n\\nAm I the asshole here for expecting them to honor what they promised me? \",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nI have lunch daily at a self-service restaurant not far from home which has an affordable price and good quality food + complimentary glass of juice, and it\\'s probably my best place to eat. But although the food is really good, the service doesn\\'t live to the expectation. The waiters are either too busy cleaning tables and restocking the food on the buffet or not even around for you to call them, and even though it\\'s a self-service place and you should have everything you need ready for picking, sometimes you need ice or some napkins, but good luck getting it from them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy plate consists of mostly salad and I like some seasonings to go with it, but today there was no olive oil or lime around, which I really like. So I finish my plate (already looking for a waiter but surprise, there are none around), sit down and I see one of them carrying dirty plates to the kitchen, passing right beside me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI quickly raise my hand and ask him: \"Excuse me, could you please bring me olive oil or lime? There was none on the buffet.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe waiter just nods: \"Sure, just wait a minute\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI wait for about 4 minutes until I taste my chicken and beans and notice they are starting to get cold. I look around, again, he\\'s nowhere in sight. I decide to just start eating it slowly, maybe he\\'ll get here sooner or later. I start eating and eating, but like I said, my plate is mostly salad so I didn\\'t have much of a choice other than to eat it as well. 15 - 20 minutes after waiting, my plate is just a single piece of chicken and a spoonful of beans.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen, out of nowhere, here he comes with a lime cut in half for me to squish in my salad and a bottle of olive oil. I look at him trying to think of something to say and in the end I just go: \"Thanks but I don\\'t need it anymore\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe waiter looks offended: \"What do you mean? Didn\\'t you ask for these?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI reply: \"Yeah, like 20 minutes ago. I\\'m done with my plate already.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHe just glares at me with hate and walks out muttering stuff like: \"Wasted a lime for this guy\" and \"Don\\'t ask if you\\'re not gonna wait\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m a pretty chill guy, and I really like the food of the place so I didn\\'t want to cause any commotion or call a manager or the sort, so I just finished my plate and came home, and am now writing this to you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShould I have just waited? Or maybe gone to the kitchen to ask it from someone else? Wouldn\\'t that make it worse when he came back though? I\\'m at a bit of a loss right now.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo my girlfriend and I have been having a debate about people in a relationship changing their physical appearance without speaking to their SO. Context: A while back she got a second tattoo (on her ribs so not visible) without asking me, I was completely fine with that as it's a nice tattoo. Now she has been planning to dye her hair this year but chose the colour (orange) and bought it without consulting me. She hasn't dyed it yet but it sparked this debate. I still am happy to let her do that, we just want to see reddits opinion on this. She believes that her physical appearance shouldn't play a big role in the relationship. (Things easily changed like hair and that don't impact her health like weight). \\nSo, AITA for wanting to be told about any type of 'big' physical change she is going to go through? We aren't fighting at all, just interested in a general poll.\\n\\nDisclaimer: She checked the whole post before I posted as to make it unbiased. \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': \"So what happened was me and my friend got out of class and I had another class on the other side of campus. I decided to drive over there and my friend was asking for a ride and after I said no he opened the door anyways and got in. I drove him to his car, it wasn't that out of the way. I was waiting for him to get off and he just sat and talked and I said you gotta go I got to get to class. Now this friend is pretty handsy and loves to poke you and tickle you. He started messing with me pretty vigorously. Its important to note that the car is not in park and I am pushing the brake pedal. I get pushed and lose my footing of the pedal and my car starts rolling towards the concrete barrier. I press what I think is the brake pedal, but it is not and we hit the concrete barrier. \\n\\nI have insurance, however it does not cover my car. So all the expenses are coming out of pocket. The reason why my insurance is not normal is because this car is a 2005 Infinity G35 and any accident will be ruled a total loss. Ive fixed cars in the past, but this is far and away above my knowledge and expertise. I took it to a mechanic that says he can fix it up and that it doesn't look nearly as bad as it is. He said I can expect the price to be 1.5-2.5 thousand. \\n\\nNow would be important to talk about our financial backgrounds. I am from a well off family that has been very supportive. My parents let me know that they will give me a no interest loan, but they will not give me any money. Which I am very thankful for, and do not expect any money from them. My parents never have given an allowance or any type of free money. This does not mean that they don't occasionally buy me clothes or food. As a full time college student it is hard to maintain a full time job. I would usually have 2 part time jobs, now I am down to one job that pays around $450 a month. It's not a lot but its what I can manage as a full time student. Now my friend is not as fortunate as I am. His parents do give him some spending money though. Which he routinely blows on alcohol or weed. That's as far as I know about his financial background. After the accident I realized if I should not push him away or break the friendship because of this accident. Especially if I were to ask for some money. So my question to you is if I should ask for his help in paying a mistake that I think is 75% his fault. And if so how much.  \\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ok basically my old beater car, a 2004 sunfire had broke down, so we got it towed to a mechanic to see what was wrong with it. In the meantime my mom got a new car and I had been driving her old one. The mechanic got back to us saying it just needed a new battery but we didn\\'t have enough space for three cars so I told my mom if she covered the fixing cost I could sell it, and she agreed. \\n\\nWell today I told her that I had been trying to find a buyer for $600 and she told me that I should give it to my late stepdads nephew. I told her that I didn\\'t want to give it away for free and she said that I should. But I kept saying I wouldn\\'t because it just got new brakes, new battery, oil changed recently and I put a new radio in it. So I wanted to get at least $600 for it. My mom kept guilt tripping me into giving away my car but I kept saying no. Then she says \"fine, sell it. But if you do you\\'re gonna give me the money because I paid for the brake repairs.\" I said that was bullshit and I\\'m not gonna do that because I\\'m pretty pressed for cash right now, being a student. She told me if I did sell it she would take the money but since I\\'ve been taking law I told her that she can\\'t legally do that. Now she\\'s being petty and guilt tripping me and saying \"I won\\'t do shit for you.\" \\n\\nI\\'m being steadfast in my position but I\\'m wondering if I am actually being an asshole. \\n\\nEdit: I should have stated the money she used to fix my car and buy her new one was left to us by my step father.

       "  'selftext': 'I (M/17) wrote some lyrics about an ex of mine who cheated on me with my best friend and throughout the course of our relationship, told me that she loved me. After a few fights and patching things up, I still had some remaining anger so I wrote some lyrics to vent. These lyrics were angry, detailed the events of an intimate relationship gone sour and adapted for a Metal style, I will not be posting them as I need to protect myself and my art. I did not post the lyrics anywhere and didn\\'t share them out to anyone. at a later date I was talking to a few friends of mine and her (my ex) name comes up in conversation and as such, so do the lyrics. My friend (let\\'s call her *Rose*) asked to read them, I then warned her that the lyrics were very angry and explicit. She and another friend of mine (let\\'s call him Jim) read them [in person] Once she has, she labels them as sexist. After prior events two days go by, I do not speak to Rose and Jim asks me to send him the lyrics (I obviously decline). The third day during lunch break, Rose approaches me and tells me to stay away from my ex and informs me that my lyrics are \"The kind of thing that ends me up on a fucking list.\" Rose and I had been friends for nearly two and a half years, and after this interaction she made it clear that she was no longer comfortable talking with me. Also she and Jim apparently informed my ex of the Lyrics existence. Keep in mind that she (my ex) and I had been working towards building a better friendship until Rose and Jim told her about this. Later that day Jim and I got in a brief fight after I questioned him about why he wanted the lyrics (He had planned to show them to my ex). Jim and I did eventually patch things up. But as for Rose she is no longer talking to me which I respect, but I worry that she may be slandering me behind my back. Now these lyrics were very personal, in asking some very close friends of mine who are women for their opinion, none of them find the lyrics sexist given the context of the situation. What I ask you here today, is this: Am I the asshole for these lyrics? they were never intended for anyone else\\'s eyes, I only told Jim and Rose about them because they asked me directly and I thought that I could trust them. Should I hold true and stand my ground on this? Or should I apologize for my art?\\n\\nEdit: to all those stating INFO, Once I post the lyrics online I have actually ethically done something wrong. the lyrics detail the way she manipulated and treated me and I also call myself out for ignoring problems out of want to make it work. that is what I can give you to go off of.',\n",

The cops have been really nice and all of them say they can’t even hear the music from the street and they just leave. She has called the cops on us about 20 times now and every time the cops don’t care and say they have to show up because it’s required. We don’t even play the music late .

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\n  The other day, I was talking with cousin over the phone about Smash Bros, and he was very vocal about how much he hated it. He talked about how toxic the community was, how bad the game mechanics were, and then he expanded how bad games have become so bad because there\\'s so easy and shorter than before since unlike with old games, you don\\'t have to start the entire game over again with newer games if you lose a life. He went on to tell me for the 5th time that whenever he plays a game, he makes sure to reset the entire thing (meaning erasing all save files and resetting all options)whenever he loses because otherwise it wouldn\\'t be \"perfect\". I told him games are like this now because nowadays people don\\'t have the time nor patience to dedicate hours to playing games like they used to, so forcing players or yourself to restart the entire thing is just really impractical. He then went on to tell me how he can\\'t have it any other way because God calls him a loser if he doesn\\'t reset the game every time he loses. I then went on to ask \"Maybe you\\'re wrong about this, God isn\\'t telling you anything, and you\\'re telling yourself this?\" He then said \"I\\'m a fucking Toontown noob, I will never admit I\\'m wrong.\" To this, I said \"okay then, bye.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I feel like what I did here was rude since I should be more considerate of someone who\\'s clearly angry over something, but at the same time he\\'s given me similar rants for the past year and they haven\\'t seem to change much so I wanted to give some kind of negative reinforcement.

       "  'selftext': 'My (20) dad has always claimed me on his taxes while my mom claimed my sister (19). I always looked up to my dad while my sister usually comes by when she wants something. He has a better job than my mom and has had a better career overall than my mom. I would always hang out with my dad every opportunity I got. I got my temporary permit and then got my license. As I got my license, my sister got her temporary permit. She let that expire. And then another set. One more set on top of that. She finally decided to go to driving school and then as she had her fourth temporary permit passed the driving test. She never claimed she wanted to drive. She liked to boast about being chauffeured around. My dad\\'s credit was improving and he decided he wanted to get a new vehicle. He got one, but didn\\'t want to trade in his old SUV. He had it for a few years prior and knew the transmission has been replaced. He put a few hundred dollars into it over the few years and he let me drive it around. Usually I would be going to school or work. He said that I was financially responsible for it. In the summer of 2018 my sister got her license and got her car. She worked all summer to save for it. I found an opportunity to go to Europe so I was working toward that goal. About 10 days after my sister got her car totalled. The insurance covered her car but it wasnt as flashy as my sister likes. \\nToday she sent me a screen shot of a tweet that said, \"The Toyota that boy bought is worth more than the range rover handed down to that other kid.\" Or something along the lines.\\nAITA for using my dads vehicle?',\n",

       "    'body': \"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nA little history on me to provide context; I’ve been through a lot of trauma in the past four years and have horrible anxiety, depression, abandonment issues, trust issues, self-esteem issues, and possible PTSD. I’ve always struggled with my mental health but this past year it has gotten to a new low. I’m attempting to fix myself through therapy and medication which has helped tremendously, but everything takes time. I isolated myself from everyone a few years ago (including this friend). And since then I’ve made no effort to really get close to anyone, other than her.  I’m pretty bad at showing affection, but care for people greatly. I give people surprises constantly (food/ drinks/ presents/whatever) as a way to let them know I’m thinking about them.\\n\\nA little history on our friendship/ her; I know she loves and cares about me and I know that my thoughts of her not caring about me are (probably) just in my head, so I tired to not include any of those thoughts in this post. She's a really sweet girl and really nice and caring. She puts a lot of effort into everything she does, including friendships (which maybe is why I'm hurt because I feel like she's putting effort into her friendships with everyone BUT me BUT that's beside the point I guess). She's a nice girl, and I do not think she'd do anything to purposely hurt me, but I also do not think she'd have the guts to friend- breakup with me, especially while we still live together.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOKAY...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI’ve known my (best?) friend for a little over four years, but we’ve only really been close the past two. We spent all our free time together last year, and talked constantly. We moved in together in June, and everything was going very well. She expressed her desire to make more friends/ be more social this year and I fully supported her (as I explained, I’m not a very social person anymore and being around people makes me very anxious, so I very rarely feel comfortable going out. I wanted her to be able to go out in large groups and have fun).\\n\\nIn the beginning it was really nice, and she’d go out a few times a week and see her new friends, and we’d still have some time together to do whatever we wanted. I was happy for her. Then she started to go out more and more with her new friends, and I realized it was starting to bug me. I put it to my poor mental health (I’m very insecure and have abandonment issues lmao) and ignored it. I forget exactly what I was going through at this time, but my mental health was very poor at this time. Eventually I got drunk one night and cried to her about how lonely I was and that I needed her company/ support.\\n\\nI knew that she already had plans for a few nights that week (like the upcoming 3 days), but I saw her making more and more plans for that week and the following week. I tried to push off my hurt feelings, but after barley seeing her at all for two weeks I took it personally. I distance myself as a defense mechanism and basically just see it like you know, if they’re going to leave me, let me not care first.\\n\\nSo, I was extremely distant to her, and our home environment was pretty tense. She confronted me after about two weeks, and I told her that it really hurt me that it seemed like she went out of her way to avoid seeing me after I told her how lonely I was. She said that it seemed like I was just jealous/ upset that she was making new friends, and said that she did not really want to be put in a bad headspace by being near me. I told her that the only part of her having new friends that upset me, was that it seemed like I was now a backup plan, like she could just say “oh, no one else is free but OP will be at home, so whatever”. It hurt me that she was actively making plans with everyone but me, and it seemed like she no longer considered me a friend, but rather just a roommate. She ended up apologizing and said that she thought I just needed space, so that’s what she was giving me. We made up and things seemed fine. She made more of an effort to make plans with me and it was nice.\\n\\nAfter winter break I started to feel like things were off, but again just blamed my mental health. We ended up getting into a fight about something so stupid, and it started with me asking her to spend time with me this weekend. We “play” (at least on my part) fought and I jokingly told her “Hey!!!! was going to surprise you when you got home with some food but!!! Look what you did!!” She took it personally and we both ended up upset. Essentially, she took it to heart, and saw it as me punishing her and as showing that my ‘nice gestures’ were not really ‘nice’. I took it as she saw my (not) ‘nice gestures’ as being a way to guilt her into being my friend which, obviously feels shitty. I ended up apologizing to her even though I still do not fully understand what I did wrong (other than understanding that I said something that hurt her). She said she needed spaced and time. She ended up apologizing to me later that night and things were… fine.\\n\\nHOWEVER, the more I thought about the situation and this past month the more upset I got. It hurt me that she would think that I would do ‘nice’ things just to guilt her and just whatever. I’ve stopped bringing her any gifts (which is very weird for me- I’m someone where if I get something for myself, I’m getting things for other people as well. Or even if I’m just thinking about them, I’ll go out and buy them gifts) and just found myself to be distant. I tried to push past it, but I noticed her again, making more and more plans with people, and never making any plans with me. I sensed that she did not seem to be as excited to talk to me about her day/ whatever as she was with other people. Like you know how you can just tell by their face/ voice they’re excited? I wasn’t picking up on that, and it hurt me. I thought I had picked up on that before too, but had always pushed it aside. I wouldn’t text her throughout the day, and she wouldn’t text me. And it just, it’s stupid but it just hurts me.\\n\\nI really think she sees me as just a roommate now, someone who will be there when she can’t find anyone better. I’m just sad, and just don’t know if I’m the one being an asshole for distancing myself, not that I guess I think she cares. I’m trying to make living together still comfortable but I guess what I’m trying to say is…\\n\\nTLDR; AITA for distancing myself from my roommate after she made new friends/ for not being able to accept the role from friend to roommate\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSome backstory on the ex friend:\\n\\nSo basically an ex boyfriend of mine was hitting up my ex friend. Now for the sake of the story and saving some confusion let’s call her Anna. Anna told me my ex was hitting her up and trying to talk to her. I said “hey dude if that’s happening please don’t entertain it, it would really hurt me if you did”. Now this ex boyfriend was my first everything including first major heartbreak and first time having sex. A couple weeks go by and Anna says “hey did I tell you that [ex boyfriend] is trying to talk to me? he won’t stop lol” (the way she said this felt a little braggy?) and I was like “yes you told me” and I reiterated again for her not to entertain it and if she did that would tremendously hurt me. Fast forward about 3 months... come to find the fuck out they’ve been talking the whole time and hanging out/fucking and now she has feelings for him. When I tell you i’ve never felt a hurt like this mannnnnn i’m not lying. I cried for hours over it because how could some one that was my best friend for 10 YEARS do me so dirty like that. I confront her and cut off the friendship (she never apologized or even answered the text I sent confronting her). \\n\\nNow this is where the mutual friend of ours comes in:\\n\\nLet’s call this friend Jenna. Me and Jenna have been friends for 11 or so years, so Jenna and Anna have been friends about 9 (I introduced them). When this situation initially happened I told Jenna “I’m not going to pick your friends for you because that is none of my business. Your relationship with Anna is your business so even though this situation happened, who you are friends with is not my say.”  As the months go on and they hang out I can’t help but feel a pang in heart seeing that, knowing what she did to me and knowing that my best friend (Jenna) is having fun with her and all that stuff. On one hand I feel like okay you’re an adult and this is what happens sometimes, you’re not allowed to dictate someone’s relationship with another person. But on the other hand, It really hurts me to see someone I care about so much, that I sat there and cried in front of her for hours about this situation, hang out with the person that hurt me terribly. WIBTA if I told her how I feel about them hanging out and that it hurts me? \\n\\nTLDR: Ex best friend was seeing my ex boyfriend behind my back even when I told her not to entertain it. My other best friend (and mutual friend between ex best friend and me) still hangs out with the ex best friend and it makes me uncomfortable/ feel hurt.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': 'So some backstory, I (17F) got into a huge argument with my father (57F) this past Thursday. It has now been 3 days since I’ve said anything to him, and honestly I don’t want to talk to him. \\n\\nMy mom asked me to come out to the living room to talk to be with my father present because she had noticed that something had been putting me in a bad mood lately and she wanted to talk to me about it. So, I explained to her and him that a lot of it was how my father had been reacting to things I said, and in general, being very disrespectful and inconsiderate of my feelings. \\n\\nHe proceeds to flip out at this information. He began playing the victim card (“it’s always my fault”) when I tried discussing with him that some ways he says stuff bothers me. This turned into him completely not listening to me and he began full on yelling. \\n\\nMy mom then says “you guys need a mediator” to which he FLIPS out and yells “I DONT NEED A GODDAMN MEDIATOR” and storms up to me from across the room and starts screaming obscenities in my face. \\n\\nThis is not an isolated incident. Even at an appointment with a counselor, he acted the same way and refused to listen or even try to understand my point of view. This has also happened countless times with my mother. To me it seems like he refuses to accept responsibility for any issues and forces blame onto any easy target, which lately has become me. \\n\\nSo Reddit, AITA for refusing to accept this behavior from my father? Is there something else I can do?',\n",

So she streams pretty often and she likes having me and my best friend James in her overwatch streams. One day when she’s streaming with us I say the N-Word (I am a black guy btw) and one of her viewers says “reported for letting people say the n-word in your stream” and I write this off as being a random ignorant ass person. However Jessica makes a big deal out of it after the stream and asks me to stop saying it when she streams because she thinks it’s against TOS. Because of that I agreed cause I didn’t want her to get banned off twitch and for me to be the reason, but I did take the time to read it over for myself since every 2K stream that you go into there’s someone saying the N-word. So I looked into twitch’s terms of service and they said that they will ban people for being blatantly racist within context basically so for me if I say the N-word as a term that’s not meant to offend anyone in a racist manner you won’t get banned from Twitch essentially. Now knowing this I go back to her and let her know but she still insists I don’t say it because I might offend her audience of Caucasian viewers (she didn’t say Caucasian viewers but I know black people aren’t the ones watching this stream). This really annoyed me so we had a little back in forth about how asinine I thought it was that I as a black person had to stop saying the n word out of fear that I might offend a white person. And her saying she didn’t want to annoy her audience as she’s still trying to grow her channel. That conversation ended in both of us being annoyed at the other and I left to go get some food. When I returned she had gone to bed and only James was still in the discord so I talked to him. He told me that when I was gone they talked about it and she said if I wouldn’t stop saying it she just wouldn’t put me in her streams. Which I honestly completely understood if that’s what she wanted to do. So the next day I told her just don’t stream when you play with me cause that’s not a word I want to give anyone the power to take away from me as a black man. (I feel very strongly about the subject cause I’ve experienced a fair amount of racism throughout my life and especially within the internet community, like I deadass can’t even count how many grown ass men scream the n-word hard R and all into their microphones in online games after learning I’m black) anyway after I told her this she flipped out, saying how we were the only people she played overwatch with and this and that so I caved and said I’d try to stop saying it out of respect for her. This still deeply bothers me though and I can’t tell if I’m just being blindly stubborn over this or not. I can tell that she thinks it’s just a word but it’s more important than just a word to me.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "  'selftext': 'We\\'re in a program that helps autistic adults become independent. This program takes place in an apartment complex in which we each get one roommate (2 people per apartment, 6 people in total). We\\'ve been dealing with drama regarding a \"client\" here for weeks. He\\'s been making romantic advances on my roommate (including touching her ass), has called me hurtful names, and treats his roommate and everyone else horribly. We\\'ll call him Mike (not his real name for privacy). \\n\\nWe recently found out that Mike is being discharged from the program--much to our (me, my roommate\\'s, and two of our guy friends\\') relief. He initially lied to his roommate (one of the guy friends) saying he was getting discharged from his primary care. However, Mike\\'s case manager wishes to fight the discharge--not that the staff of the program will agree to it as they are tired of Mike\\'s bullshit. \\n\\nDue to the mounting drama, her depression, and people spreading rumors  (Mike, and a few others most likely), my roommate cut herself for (presumably) the very first time. I didn\\'t see the cutting happen, but my roommate showed me the cut on her arm that she had made and was on the phone with the local Crisis team. I\\'m very close with her to the point where we\\'re like sisters, and I\\'m very concerned for her. She\\'s opened up to me in the past, and told me she has made a few suicide attempts, and that she has depression. I\\'m basing my suggestion on the rule (?)  that \"if a friend tells you a \\'secret\\' that is potentially dangerous to their health, tell an authority figure\". In our case the \"authority figure\" would be staff. \\n\\nI want to tell the staff about this incident, but I also don\\'t want to butt my head into business I should not be involved in (even though Mike has done hurtful things towards me as well but I have already informed the staff of that). The longer Mike is here, the more I feel my roommate will suffer and possibly cut herself even more, maybe even lash out at me or one of our guy friends if it gets to that extremity. She\\'s already barred him from being in our apartment and blocked his number, but who knows. \\n\\nWIBTA if I told staff that my roommate cut herself, even if she told them already? ',\n",

It\\'s on her bucket list of places to go to and she missed out on doing it last year. I\\'m a fairly outdoorsy person and it looks pretty cool so she\\'s totally convinced me and I\\'m totally down to do this. Alice is a planner and does all the research for when the best times are. We talked about it together after the research and decide on a couple of possible time slots. The day that tickets open up, we both wake up at 7 am and proceed to click refresh for around an hour get into the website to buy the tickets. Finally, I manage to get in after 50 minutes of clicking the page and buy a reservation for 2 for a time slot we picked under my name. This means I have to be there to claim the tickets the day of. Keep in mind, these are really hard to get and were completely sold out for the year by the end of the first day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe were talking in the car yesterday and I made a joke that even if we broke up, the tickets are in my name and I\\'d keep them. She says in that case, I should transfer them to her (which is totally possible via the website and of course she would pay me full price of the tickets). She thinks she should get the tickets since it was her original idea to go and she did all the research for the best times. I think I get to keep the tickets since I\\'m also excited to go now, spent the time to acquire them and it\\'s under my name. We both read this subreddit so we decided to let reddit users vote on who is in the \"right\". So in this scenario, WIBTA if I didn\\'t give transfer her the tickets in that scenario?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: We both now realize this sound insanely unhealthy for the relationship but it never really was that heated an argument. We think it\\'s hilarious that we\\'re finally using a subreddit we both read and we\\'re not about to break up. Also, tickets can\\'t be split, it\\'s all or nothing.',\n",

Salads, stuff to make sandwiches, frozen crap, etc... \\n\\nOne day when I\\'m coming in to start my day, I see a guy take 6 lunchable protein packs out of the fridge. If you are not familiar with these things, they are meat, cheese, and nuts or a chocolate snack.[http://www.proteinproteinprotein.com/en/originals](http://www.proteinproteinprotein.com/en/originals) \\n\\nThis guy then proceeds to make a sandwich out of the meats AND THROW THE REST OF THE PACK AWAY! \\n\\nI\\'m am not easily offended, but this got me. I was so poor growing up, that we didn\\'t have food sometimes, and this got me heated. \\n\\nAlthough it may be passive aggressive I decided to leave this picture on his desk. Didn\\'t wanna make a huge scene. I mean, this is my place of work. I even decided to cut the part off that said \"Jerk\". A work buddy of mine text me saying that he was causing a huge scene over the weekend. Calling me a bitch, and saying he \"didn\\'t need this crap\". \\n\\nHe then proceeded to put the picture back on my desk with the Jerk portion dug out of my trash and put it back with the picture. \\n\\nAt first, I thought, hmm, maybe it was none of my business. But EFF THAT! It is my business. This place is my community, and I am very grateful for the free foods. They only buy about 40-50 of the little packs for approx. 200 employees every couple of days. I mean we have lunch meat if you wanna sandwich. You don\\'t have to throw away more than half of a container of food, because you only want a small portion of it.  Not to mention the 795 million people in the world that are literally starving.\\n\\nIDK guys AITA?\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

About 20 minutes into our conversation and breakfast/lunch she realizes that she has an appointment and has to rush out the door. She usually drives herself to her appointments. She asked me 12 minutes before her appointment time if I would drive her. I was not prepared to do so.

I got up a little after noon after tossing and turning so I opted to get up at 1215 or so. She was prepping some food to cook (veggies and such for salads) when she realized she had an appointment. Before that we were just having our usual conversations about what we both had planned today, the dog, and other otherwise pleasant conversation. About 20-30 min. She then said sorry she had to leave the kitchen a mess. Her appointment was at 1300. She apologizes a lot for things that do not require one. I told her I would take care of it. She then asked I I could take her to her appointment. I probably had a tired look on my face that said “Sure...but I don’t want to” but I have taken her many times in said situation before. I did not make any notion of yes or no. She then said never mind and said she would drive/Uber. I do not mean to put my wife down here, but she is chronically late for most things.',\n",

A few months before I stopped talking to my mum, she kicked out my sisters without any notice, just as they got home from school. My parents divorced and had a messy marriage. My dad was physically abusive and narcissistic, but I still do see him and even talk to him, especially when I'm studying with him. Both sisters live with him.\\n\\nDuring the divorce, my mum was awarded both the 7-bedroom house and his investment property. And from what I was told, she nearly got his current flat, but I won't get too much into how she didn't get it, as legality may be a bit confusing.\\n\\nNow, my mum is clearly not taking it well. Sometimes I feel sorry and bad for her, sometimes I just feel extremely annoyed and not empathetic. I suspect that a year before I stopped talking to my mum, she prevented me from seeing my dad, but she denies this. I had proof, but that phone broke, and now I have to depend on my memory, and I've been made to believe that I remembered things wrong.\\n\\nEvery time I look at her, I just feel mildly angry. Her state consists of noticeable liposuctions and cosmetic surgeries. To me, she is a daily reminder of where all the money that she claimed to not have for me to shower daily and have heating, went. From what I know, she never worked a full-time job in her life. There's always an excuse.\\n\\nThen again, she does take care of me and buy me clothes. Even though I cook my own meals and take care of myself, she has and still does her part. Am I crazy and the asshole here?\\n\\nEdit: she pulled me and herself out of this family counselling thing when she apparently had an argument with the people there.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So my girlfriend and i have been dating for over a year 1/2 and we haven\\'t had any major problems in our relationship. Until recently, we have been getting into small tiffs over minuscule issues that i don\\'t see have any real impact over anything. I\\'m not going to lie on here but i tend to be the jealous type, but i don\\'t let it affect my actions or anything i say to my girlfriend. But even since high school she has been friends with this guy that lived near her neighborhood, this all occurred way before i even met her. They still keep in touch even after having a history together while in high school, but i have met the guy a couple times, he plays basketball at our rival college. He doesn\\'t seem like a bad person but he acts strange around her when i was there. I never say anything about it because it isn\\'t my place to confront her about her friend, so i just bottle it up and seal it away. This morning my girlfriend is at work, and i hear a ring at our doorbell so i get out of bed to see that he had delivered her an edible arrangement, saying \"I\\'m sorry he didn\\'t send you one last year, hope this makes up for it, love ya xxx Happy Valentines Day\". This really upset me so when she got home i confronted her and she was adamant defending him saying how they\\'re just friends and how he doesn\\'t have those feeling for me. This just isn\\'t setting right in my head, can you all please help out! Thank you for reading.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nedit\\\\* I went off saying how he has these feelings for her, i did raise my voice when confronting her. i told her it made me uncomfortable that he had sent them and it wasn\\'t sitting right in my head that he did, i the told her \"why cant you see that he has these feelings, he texts you in the middle of the night, he wants to hang out every other day, he sent you this damn edible arrangement for valentines day. this just isn\\'t adding up\" i was raising my voice at this because in all honesty i was pissed.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nBackground: I recently moved back to large US city after several years of major depression. This was a victory for me. I have been doing well, but I had to quit a job before Christmas because of inappropriate behavior from my boss. I have been job hunting, and I have money saved to pay rent/live on, but the past few weeks have been very difficult in regards to the depression. I am on medication and am experienced with dealing with this illness, but my roommate feels I am bringing him/her down when they are home and that they need me to move out. They feel my depression is \"contagious\" and that I am causing them stress. I understand the detrimental behaviors depression can bring about. I am maintaining a homeostasis as best I can: I clean up the apartment while he’s at work; keep myself clean and my space, avoid him if I am not feeling sociable; etc. I’m mostly in my room. He says when he does see me I am maudlin and it’s causing him to be *depressed*. That when I’m curt I’m being an asshole - that I’m an asshole because I monopolize the apartment because I’m always home. I admittedly I don’t go out much (haven’t left the apartment in about a week) - mostly I’m trying to save money, though honestly I haven’t had the desire to. And I am not very talkative right now. \\n\\nI know I’m not directly being an asshole. I’m not a malicious or passive aggressive person. But I am always home. I am not fun to be around. I do keep myself sequestered, and I have little patience for his “humorous sarcasm.”\\n\\nThis isn’t meant to come off as self pity, though perhaps that’s unavoidable. My question, though: is my indirect behavior assholey ? \\n\\nI have to go because he is the leaseholder, but I wonder if I deserve this. Is he just looking out for what’s best for him or is he just using this as an excuse? \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also love my 12 year old pup just as much who without going into too much detail has been plagued with ill health recently causing me to play over $1500 just last year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy fiance really wants us to be married in the same church her parents got married, however the place over the years has grown very popular causing the price of the ceremony there to be well over budget. When I suggested we got married somewhere cheaper but still nice saying \"the place may not be where you wanted but it will still be special to us\" she began to cry before very aggressively suggesting I should \"let my damn dog die in peace\" to afford her dream wedding. Although I try to be discreet about the amount I spend on my dog she must have found out somehow and it will not get any cheaper soon.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI honestly find her words very hurtful and what I thought was just a snarky remark said in the heat of the moment has since become the topic of many hostile debates. She can\\'t see that I\\'m not choosing my dog over her but i\\'m creating a compromise so that my beloved pet can continue his happy life for as long as possible. He is not in any visible pain, just has seen better days and although I hate to make my fiance sad I will stand by my choice.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: AITA For not funding my fiancees \"dream wedding\" so I can afford the well being of my much loved dog?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: With the majority of people saying NTA I thought it may be a good idea to show her this post to try to help her see my point. She absolutely did not appreciate that, spending the entire night lambasting me for sharing private information online and being selfish before packing a suitcase and leaving to stay with her parents a few hours away. Looks like the issue may be solved..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 2: It is also worth saying my fiancee has always been jealous of my dog since I made the mistake of telling her I once drunkenly did the ol\\' peanut butter penis and I\\'m not proud to say that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 3: It\\'s official, I\\'ve broken it off with my fiance and she is looking into how she can legally get some kind of custody of my dog to spite me.

Recently, for some reason I can't really pinpoint my depression has gone downhill majorly. I wasn't thinking too much when I did it but I tried to overdose in our bathroom in a moment of blind desperation, I later woke up in the hospital after my husband called 911 and when I was eventually allowed to return home I expected him to be frantic and worried but he was enraged at me, he said I'm a horrible person and a terrible mother for trying to abandon him and our daughter, adding that she could have came home and found me like that, or he'd have had to explain my death to her.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Who i will call John(not real name)) The Server Owner (Who I will call Alex(not real name)) There is also the chief of police (Chief). So I am online as a cop one day, and John pulls a gun. this is a no-no because the server rules say that if there is less then 2 officers online, no hostages or mugging. so I just speed off in my Crown Vic. he then warns me for \"FearRP\" (not fair, he was not allowed to do this in the first place. So of course i tell Alex. this turned out to be a mistake because he told John about it. John immediately starts SCREAMING at me about being a \"snitch\" (he broke a server rule, clearly stated in our rules section. fast forward to the next day. I get the following message from Chief \"In response to the incident Sunday night both you and (Other Dude) are on Suspension. You both need to reevaluate your decision in being in the department. If you wish you will granted the opportunity to reapply for PD on 2/18/19. \" The other dude had nothing to do with the incident, so i talked to john about it. turns out, he told Chief and Alex about some other Shit that did not even happen, and nobody believes he is lying at all. so now, me and another innocent dude am not on the police force, and John is still an Abusing Admin. Nobody cares. Am i the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: I should mention that my response to John about this info was worded in such a way that I am not writing it on a website accessible to children.\\n\\nEdit2: John just got fired and I am a cop again.

       "  'selftext': \"So obviously there are two sides to this story and I can't go into all the details but essentially my three housemates asked me and my girlfriend to move out without any warning. The reason being that me and one of my housemates were having some trouble. The main issue here is definitely that we were not communicating about the problems we were having. I am a busy human and work 40 hours a week while also going to school full time for the most intensive subject at our University. I will often come home stressed during the semester to find said housemate has invited several people over to drink and have a good time. This is all fine and dandy but I have asked several times for this roommate to text me and let me know people are over so I can be ready for that when I get home, which never happened. I was extremely frustrated by this (and several other small things) and I'm sure it was apparent but I never said anything rude. I admit there were times where I was bitter but I would always keep it between me and my girlfriend. I'd like to again recognize that I am definitely at blame for some of these things and that I shouldn't have neglected to communicate for so long. The thing that has really gotten to me is that for the last month I was certain that things were getting much better and was actually beginning to feel like me and this housemate were getting along great! I don't really need to get into the specific details, but essentially they sent my girlfriend a Google document out of the blue that said they were frustrated with some things and that they wanted me to move out. The things on the list were really manageable and easy for me to fix, this really confused me especially because they hadn't brought anything up before. After further investigation, one of my other housemates informed me that the housemate that I was having problems with was the one that was really pushing for me to move out and that she gave them a him or me situation. I then found out that this housemate, instead of talking with me about the issues she was having, talked with anyone who would listen about how terrible of a housemate I was, some of the things she was saying were true but some of them were blatantly untrue. Because I haven't talked about my problems with said housemate to anyone but my girlfriend, all of my closest friends have turned against me because they have only heard what she has had to say, this obviously hurts. my co-workers knew about the problems she was having before I knew, folks that weren't in town knew about this before me, people I had never talked to knew about this before I had a clue. \\n\\nI would like to respect the wishes of everyone in my house but I feel like I've been ganged up on and not given an opportunity to change/defend myself. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to hold my ground and not move out?\\n\\n(EDIT) \\nMore info: \\n--- The things that were getting on their nerves were: Me leaving the window open when my room is hot and the air conditioning is on, me taking showers early in the morning, me not cleaning the house because it wasn't my mess (one time), me leaving my towel on the bathroom floor, me not wanting to hang out after work and socialize.\\n--- We rent the house all together, have been living there for 4 months.\\n--- Housemate is hurt by the way I had been acting but wouldn't give specifics, I'm also very confused Reddit. I have apologised but housemate is no longer interested in trying to fix the problem. \\n--- I don't want to be the dick but one of my housemates suggested that I hold my ground because I live there and shouldnt be forced out without proper communication.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '(Throwaway account and keeping identities vague just in case)\\n\\nA coworker of mine has a history of... interesting behavior...  and recently disclosed mental illness as the cause. I have noticed that this coworker has a serious filter on how they interpret events (manager will say “X” and coworker will swear they were told “Y” when we were all in the same meeting and heard/understood “X”).  Entire interactions will be edited in their retelling to put the coworker in a victim position. It has caused a lot of tension in the past but now that the staff know there is a diagnosed mental illness, we all work with it instead of letting it cause issues. The coworker in question has worked really hard to change their relationships with some of us and things at work have been pretty good lately.\\n\\nThe coworker in question is very social and we have a lot of mutual acquaintances in our large company. One common person has been a “friend” of mine for almost 20 years but in a very arms length sort of way. We work in different areas but any time we interact it has been fun and I have always thought really highly of them. The mutual acquaintance (MA) and I have a very surface-level relationship but they are fun and funny and when we do see each other in real life we have a good time. Most of our interaction is online (social media) or through work. We have never done anything social on our own time, but I feel like I know this person well enough to feel comfortable around them.\\n\\nI noticed a while ago that my coworker and MA were spending a lot of time together all of a sudden. I hadn’t realized they knew each other and saw them having lunch together one day away from work. They were very surprised to see me and acted like kids caught in the middle of a caper. Lots of blushing, guilty looks and giggling as soon as I walked away. My coworker began mentioning our MA frequently “so and so and I are meeting up for a coffee break!” or “so and so and I just texted me the funniest thing HAHAHAHA”. Both of them are married with kids and it seemed like they were spending all of their time together when they weren’t working. I kept any thoughts to myself and if other staff mentioned suspicions about a possible relationship between them I shrugged and said I didn’t think it was likely. Not my business what other people do, not my place to comment. \\n\\nOne day the coworker was not at work and ended up being off for a few weeks. When they returned they cornered me and told me a story about the MA - the MA’s partner read texts between the two of them and an incident followed. It was a shocking story and the MA was not portrayed in a good light. We’re talking psychopath level shit that this person is being accused of. The incident was so traumatic that the coworker had to take mental health leave to recover. No mention of an affair but again, not my business. My coworker asked me to keep the story to myself and not tell anyone what happened. I asked what that meant for my interactions with the MA and my coworker got upset and said “especially not them! They can never know I told you what happened” and sobbed in my office for another hour.\\n\\nI have always really liked and gotten along well with the MA and I have doubts about whether this traumatic incident ever happened, based on my history with my coworker and my experiences with how they tend to rewrite history for dramatic effect. The MA comments on my social media from time to time and I am very conscious of the fact that my coworker sees these online interactions because they will mention them to me the next day at work.  My coworker suggested I cut ties with the MA online but I am reluctant to do that. We also have several other mutual acquaintances online who would probably notice if we were no longer connected that it would definitely raise questions. But mostly, I don’t 100% my coworker.\\n\\ntldr: Am I the asshole for not fully believing my coworker’s story about someone and wanting to maintain a relationship with the mutual acquaintance? ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'First time poster,  long time lurker,  mobile user,  blah blah blah. Probably a little bit long,  so tl;dr at bottom. \\n\\n\\nSo to get the ball rolling,  some background.  My partner is 17, and I am 18. I have already graduated year 12 last year when we weren\\'t dating.  \\n\\nMy partner (We\\'ll call her Bree) is deciding to go to her year 12 ball with one of her class mates.  She used to have a thing for this guy, they would send each other nudes etc.  They were doing these things before she and I started dating nearly a year ago. \\n\\nBeing her boyfriend,  I would love to go.  However, the school policy states that no one outside of the school or in any other grade is allowed to go.  Only the year 12 cohort for that year.  This upsets me because, well,  that\\'s my girlfriend.  I don\\'t want another guy hanging off her.  I know he will,  too.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the after party side of things. She wants to go to this big after party,  but told me straight up \"You\\'re not coming\". I told her I was actually planning on picking her up from the ball and bringing her home,  where I was going to have a surprise party organised to welcome her into the adult world and say goodbye to school. \\n\\nShe said she\\'d rather just go to this big after-party where I know from last year she\\'ll make mistakes. Everyone who went to the one last year ended up ruining their relationships by cheating on each other in that one drunken night. \\n\\nI\\'m not telling her she can\\'t go,  I just would rather she goes to this ball with one of her close female friends rather than a guy, and that she come celebrate at my place. \\n\\nAm I the asshole,  reddit? \\n\\n\\nTl;dr, girlfriend doesn\\'t really want me around on her ball night and would rather go be with drunk peoples\\n\\nEdit 1: The reason why I\\'m not allowed at the after party is because it\\'s not my graduation.

Also this is both a general question and a specific case that went wrong. \\n\\nI write smut semi professionally. I also do lewd roleplays sometimes to get the creative juices flowing. it's hard to come up with novelty for women by myself. \\n\\nI rarely go here, but if someone is very enthusiastic about my writing but brings nothing to the table for me, I'll offer to write in exchange for nudes or money. Basically I'll offer to whore myself out if they're not my type. The 'am I the asshole' conflict for me here comes from the fact that: \\n\\n1. it could be seen as inherently disrespectful to ask for nudes, regardless of services rendered or the context\\n\\n2. the assumption that a roleplay is worth sexual favors in the first place\\n\\n3. the fact that it seems like a bait and switch from the persective of the person I don't find interesting. \\n\\n4. I'm basically saying 'I'm not interested, but...'\\n\\non the 'I'm not an asshole' side, though: \\n\\n1. Don't come in here wanting to write about taking a horse cock and then act dignified/self righteous of your own purity when the topic of nudes is broached\\n\\n2. if you're not interested you're not interested. just say no or ingore me and move on. It's not like my asking cost you anything. \\n\\n3. some people have gone along with it and it was a lot of fun\\n\\n4. I woulda ghosted/said no anyway if this wasn't an option\\n\\nOne person in particular insisted on writing in broken English and cut out as many letters as they could. There was nothing appealing about it at all and I felt as if they were very dumb. I explained the situation and gave them the offer, and they bitched and moaned and argued with me for hours. I engaged out of a pure, frustrated disbelief that someone could be this dumb. \\n\\nEventually they sent me three (3) broken imgur links that they claimed to be nudes, played dumb as to why they weren't working, tried to nag at me more, and insisted they were too incompetent to use other image hosting sites. I lashed out, told them that they were either genuinely retarded or a really bad lair, and told them to fuck off until i finally blocked them. \\n\\nSo, am I the asshole? \",\n",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\n I\\'m going to try to tell the whole story here, so bear with me:  \\nI have autism, and when I was a lot younger, around 5-12 (I am 17 now, junior in HS), It was a hell of a lot worse than it is now and my parents decided to homeschool me (now my autism is much, much better).  I was enrolled in a public homeschool program that met twice a week and I had an aide with me sometimes when I had tics (those aren\\'t a problem now at all).   Back then, I also used the internet with no control, playing games in all my spare time and watching youtube whenever I could.  I eventually was allowed to install scratch, a drag-&-drop programming language for kids which I LOVED.  Eventually, without my parents knowing, I created a scratch forum account and they caught me.  I wasn\\'t allowed to use the computer at all for 6 months and from there they monitered my computer usage a ton more.  Fast forward to 5th/6th grade and I\\'m doing online school now.  Given the freedom online now, I cheated and my parents caught me when they installed more tracking software on my PC.  they made me pay $200 (a TON of money to me then) to retake the course, but this part is understandable.  fast forward again to freshman year of HS and I\\'m finally going to a public school, be it an alternative school with 15 students in the senior class. At this point, most of my symptoms of autism had gone away, save for some barely noticeable tics.  I got in trouble that year for abusing the school\\'s network, almost got suspended.    \\n\\n\\nNow at sophomore year, I feel as if my internet usage is finally justified.  I have transferred to the larger high school of 1,300 students, and I get pretty meh grades.  My parents decide to take away internet, video games, electronics until I get all B\\'s or above in my classes (chemistry was the big one here, only got a C+).  I also am not allowed to drive because of these grades.  Over the summer, I created an Instagram, Twitter, Google, Soundcloud (I produce music), discord, and reddit account, and ALL of those were HUGE, HUGE offenses in my parents eyes (I had an incident with reddit freshman year that my parents got REALLY, REALLY pissed at).  They had always told me \"no social media\" or \"no accounts\".  Now, a lot of you might say that \"I don\\'t need social media\" or \"it\\'s useless\", but to someone my age it means a lot.  It allows you to interact with people at your school that you might not know otherwise, break the ice with the girl you like, chat with friends (snapchat, instagram dms) when you want, or just share your opinion, and all this is useful for someone who is somewhat shy like me.  They found out and threatened to report me to the police for god knows what and have me suspended at school, killing my chances at a college.  They think I should focus on NOTHING but school unless my grades are there.  I can only hang out with friends on Mondays (early dismissal), fridays, and saturdays (not school nights).  I also want to say that I am extremely lazy when it comes to schoolwork.  I have had high test scores that show I should have a 4.0 GPA, but I only have a 3.3 because I don\\'t put a lot of effort into classes like chemistry or english.   \\nNow in the present, just in the beginning of second semester junior year, my grades are raised and my parents are finally going to let me learn how to drive, although the SAT comes first and that\\'s my decision (most of my friends were forced to drive the moment they turned 16 in sophomore year so the parents weren\\'t chauffeurs anymore.  Some were also forced to get a job so they can get experience).  I also can\\'t get a job because I don\\'t have a 3.5 GPA for the semester, I had a 3.45.  I got a phone for the first time halfway through sophomore year, and I have recently created an account on discord (I am HUGE into programming/computer science now and It is likely my career, this is what I use it for), Instagram (I post my graphic design here and follow my friends and favorite music artists), and reddit (I ask for advice here and discuss music).  All my friends comment on how strict my parents are.  I have to turn my phone in to them at 7:30 at night.  They haven\\'t caught me yet here, but it\\'s only a matter of time.  anyway, AITA for trying to get around their rules, or are they justified?  \\n\\n\\ntl;dr: My parents are strict and I try to get around it.  \\n \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

       "    'body': '^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\\n\\nSo, I’m in high school and over the past couple of years I’ve gotten a lot closer to my good friend, who I’ll call A. Around that time I started eating with his friend group at lunch, and now we all frequently hang out together outside of school. He confided in me at the start of last year that he used to have a crush on a girl in our group, B. He asked her out and she turned him down. 8 months later, he tells our group he’s starting to develop feelings for a girl outside our group. Soon after this, B gets a crush on me, and we start talking a lot more and eventually begin dating. Wanting to test the waters of our relationship before revealing it to the group, we wait to tell everyone until we’re two and a half months into our relationship. Everyone seems to have a positive, if not surprised reaction initially. \\n    The next week, A pulls me aside and tells me he was hurt that I didn’t tell him sooner, and that he thought we were closer. Moreover, he seems to think I had an obligation to let him know, since he’d had his crush on B for a long time. I don’t agree that my decision to wait has any bearing on our friendship, since it’s a personal choice. I assumed his feelings for her were over; it had been months since B rejected him, and he now has a crush on a different girl. \\nSoon, a mutual friend starts a rumor that B and I have been dating for 5 months- double the actual time. I find out that A believes this lie, and he goes so far as to argue that I’m wrong about my own relationship length. I’m really hurt that he wouldn’t believe me. I tell him it makes me feel uncomfortable that he’s partaking in the rumors and he gives an apology didn’t seem sincere. He later told me he wasn’t sure who to believe because I had already violated his trust by not sharing about the relationship with B.\\nDid I violate his trust by waiting to tell him? Am I in the wrong for not giving him a heads up? AITA here?\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
