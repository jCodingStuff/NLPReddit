We have 50/50 split custody.  I am a barber by trade, I am good at what I do, and I like to cut my own children's hair. I generally let the kids pick their own haircuts.  \n\nNow: My younger child has been growing out his hair since summer,  trying to get it long enough to tie back.  He has been bullied a lot by dad and grandma (who helps raise them during dad's 50%) for liking \"girly\" things like my little pony,  the colors pink and purple, and wanting dress up clothes.  They have also been pressuring him to cut his hair for the last couple months, to which I've said \"he's growing it out for winter, I'll cut it when he is ready\" .  On Sunday, during child exchange time, Grandma and I get into it over this bullying.  We have a raised voice conversation on my porch about how I am forcing my child to like girly things, and causing my older child grief from the embarrassment of having a brother who likes my little pony.  I tell her she is being a bully, that my child can choose what they like to wear and what shows to watch, older kid needs to such it up, and I would see them next week at child exchange time. Good bye.  I pick up my younger kid from school today, and they have a cropped short hack job haircut from Great Clips.  My kid says grandma pressured him into this haircut, but he doesn't hate it too bad.  On top of it feeling to me like an act of revenge for Sunday's fight, it's an awful haircut, and I had to take him into my shop after supper and fix all the uneven bits.  Bangs were crooked, cowlick wasn't cut down, and it had no texture at all.  Basically a bowl cut.  I will note that my older kid, who also needs a haircut, was not taken in for a Great Clips haircut.  I cut his hair this evening. \n\nI text ex husband and tell him that I'm a Barber,  I want to cut the kids hair.  It's my job,  my passion, and my kids.  He says it's just hair,  doesn't matter who cuts it. Can't see why this is important to me.  I try to stand my ground, tell him that next time I want to cut the kids hair and he tells me I'm being an aggressive ass and making waves for no reason.  \n\nI am fucking livid, man.  And I can't tell if I am being unreasonable or not, because I am so wrapped up in the bigger picture -  bullying of my kid for having non-conforming interests, and feeling like this haircut was a direct attack for challenging the family matriarch.  \n\nSo what do you think, reddit? Am I being the asshole for trying to demand that I be the one who makes the kids hair decisions, because I'm a Barber?  Am I being too paranoid about the reasons for this haircut?

He and I have been having problems for years but always manage to make it work (very strong personalities, but love each other anyway). But in the last six months has been some of the most stressful times in our relationship. He went through the fire academy to be a city paramedic. He's starting a whole new career. It's understandable that he's stressed out and I did my best to be there for him. With some falling out, some meltdowns, a few but very frustrating financial issues to overcome, we started to get better again. \n\nNow here is my issue. I'm a firm believer in sexual healing. Can't sleep? Sexy time. Stressed out? Fuck session. Feeling under the weather? Pound town. I really do feel like sex is 1. A great stress reliever. 2. A good way to feel closer to him 3. Great way to relieve some tension and relax. Not to mention great for headaches. Now it's gotten to the point that I can count on both hands how many times we had sex in 6 months. Before all of this it was at least once a week (hectic jobs). I tried initiating sex a few times to be rejected.. I tried to be understanding. Maybe he so stressed out that he can't concentrate on anything else and can't perform. It's not me but the starting over of a new job later in his life then he expected.  Until I found out he was masterbating at home. I then starting sending naughty pictures and nothing.. Just a few comments on how it was sexy with no physical contact.. I myself have overdone it with self pleasuring that I'm over stimulated and can't even orgasm as often as I used..\n\nI feel like it might just be me he's not attracted to anymore.. All of my sexual frustration is turning into more fights and bad thoughts.. I am trying to do everything I can to make it work and help him out when he needs it. I try my best to take care of him and his needs but my needs are not really being met.. I don't really ask for much. Love me, be there for me, hear me out/let me vent, and fuck me. I'm financially independent and pay for all my bills on my own (though he had helped me when shit hit the fan). Now the relationship is in danger because of all the stress with this as the cherry on top of a shitty sundae.. What can I do?\n\nTL; DR \nSO and don't have as much sex as we used to.

He is a very smart and funny guy who I've always gotten along with, but generally has problems getting along with a lot of people. He is constantly making inappropriate jokes, saying what's on his mind without thinking about it, offending people, and challenging authority. I've always respected his honesty and crude sense of humor, but for these reasons he has always had problems holding down jobs. I've worked at a group home for seniors with traumatic brain injuries for about two years. One day, my friend (his fiancee) asked me if I could get him a job at my group home. I was hesitant because of his personality, but there were open shifts at the home and I felt like I needed to help him out. So, I got him a job. Immediately he started to ruffle feathers. I work with  8 other people and every one of them hated John within the first two weeks. I still loved him as a friend, but even I couldn't stand working with him. He was just annoying, constantly following people around and questioning things (normal for new employees, but his way of doing it was just obnoxious and intrusive). \n\nThe first part of this incident happened like this\u2026one of his running jokes with me was about \"blumpkins\". We would both basically just say the word randomly to each other to get a laugh. One day, I was teaching him how to change a client's diaper. This was everyone's favorite client (Henry). Henry had overheard one of us say the word \"bumpkin\" and he asked what it meant. John didn't say anything and looked to me to see if I would respond. I have a great rapport with Henry as I've worked there for two years, and he asked what the word meant so I went ahead and told him. I said \"A blumpkin is when a man receives oral sex on a toilet.\" John seemed pretty surprised that I said this to a client and he said, \"You can say stuff like that to them?\" I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Well, he asked what it was. And he'll probably forget about it in 5 minutes.\" Then we moved on and that was that. Henry did forget about it. \n\nThen, about a month later, things had gotten worse with John and the rest of my coworkers/supervisors. I talked to him about this several times and he actually agreed that it would be best if he transferred group homes because of how bad his relationship with our manager was getting. The week before he was going to transfer, he was standing around talking to me while I was brushing Henry's teeth and getting him ready for bed. This night, our supervisor was a good friend of mine who had to work with John the most and was getting very frustrated with him. While I was brushing Henry's teeth, John came up to him and said, \"Hey Henry, have you ever fucked a girl in the butt?\" Henry was not amused by this question, and just scowled at John. Henry usually doesn't appreciate crude humor like this and wasn't in a great mood this evening. I gave John a look that said \"Don't push this.\" But, he did push it. He asked the same question again and Henry became visibly upset. He slammed his fist down on his wheelchair and yelled something at John that we couldn't make out. I told John that Henry had been in group homes with a traumatic brain injury since he was 18 years old, so the subject of sex and virginity is a touchy one. My supervisor witnessed this entire incident from across the room but hadn't heard what anyone had said. I immediately removed Henry from the living room and took him into his room to calm him down. As soon as I got in there, my supervisor came in and asked me what had happened. Without even thinking about it, I told her the truth. The next day, John texted me and told me that she had told our house manager what had happened and that he was being investigated for verbal abuse and got put on paid leave. He then told me that I \"better be ready to lie for him\". I told him I was not comfortable lying, especially since I had already told my supervisor the truth right after it happened. John got very upset with me because I told our supervisor the truth knowing that she didn't like him, and I should have known she would report the incident and he would get in trouble. He's right, I should have known that, but it wasn't what I was thinking about. I was thinking about Henry. His other reason for being so mad is that I taught him it was OK to say things like that to clients. \n\nIt's now been about six months since this happened. John ended up quitting before the verbal abuse investigation even concluded. He has not talked to me since. He unfriended me on Facebook and told me that I am no longer allowed in his house. This has ruined my relationship with my best friend. I do feel a little guilty for ratting him out, but it was not my intention to get him fired or hurt him in any way. I was interviewed about all of this by HR of my company and also a rep from Adult Protective Services and I told them EVERYTHING, including the \"blumpkin\" incident, which was extremely embarrassing. Even though six months has passed, I still think about this all the time and am greatly saddened by my loss of friendship with both John and my best friend.

He knew I had come into a little bit of money and spent a lot on people I hung out with so naturally he hung out with me a lot.  He was unemployed and flat broke.  I'm not going into a whole lot of details but I bought this dude a lot of stuff.  I never asked for repayment but he said when he got a job, he'd get me back. He ended up getting into trouble for stealing a bunch of stuff from this girls house during a party when she drank too much and passed out.  Him and a bunch of people pretty much just ransacked the house stealing pretty much everything and wrecking what they didn't steal.  Some how he ends up only getting 4 months of work release.  When he goes to jail he's dating some 16 year old teeny bopper and he works with another friend of mine, (we'll call him Zach) at a Car Dealership. At the car dealership some dude traded in his horse trailer for a truck, so there's this horse trailer out back of the car lot.  Chris (dude in jail) is periodically having Zach drive his teenie-weenie girlfriend up there so he can bang her in the horse trailer.  This little act of his kind of violates my morals in some way so I devise a plan to get Chris caught.  The plan goes like this: When Chris is at work next and asks Zach to go get this little bubble-gummer for another romp in the horse trailer, I call the jail he's at and tell them about it.  So a few days later, Zach calls me and tells me he's on his way to pick the twenager up.  I call the jail and tell them about the horse trailer.  Sure enough Zach gets there to drop her off and there's a corrections officer sitting in the back of the lot watching the whole thing play out. When Chris gets back to jail from his job they were only going to not let him go to work for three days....until they found out the girl was not yet a woman.

They agree but suggest that we go see a movie at the theater anyways and just see whats playing. Halfway there my stepmom changes her mind and says that we should go see it anyways because a friend told her it doesn't ruin the first movie. I tell them to not buy me a ticket for the movie because I do not want to ruin my experience with the first. We get to the theater and she tells my dad to buy the three tickets so I tell them not to buy one for me because if they do then I won't go into the theater to see the movie. They buy me a ticket anyways thinking that I'm bluffing so I sit outside for a good 15 minutes before they come back out and yell at me for ruining our night out saying that they were being generous to pay for my ticket and they paid for my plane ticket to fly out to Hawaii so I should go along with it.\n\nNow I get that plane tickets to hawaii are not cheap, especially considering that it was around christmas time and I agreed to go out there but they do crap like this all the time trying to spend money on me that I tell them I don't want them to spend before they actually spend it and say they won't try to throw it in my face later only to turn around and throw it in my face later.\n\n", "score": 30, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "2v13hy", "name": "t3_2v13hy", "created_utc": 1423260107.0, "title": "AITA For refusing to not touch my phone as the driver during a 7 hour car ride (txting&driving)", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "I figured out during a 7 hour road trip to go skiing that my sister is HARDCORE anti texting&driving.

I brought her her only birthday present this year (some art books) and everything seemed fine when I left.

We go eat at taco bell and I buy my own food. I get a quesadilla and a drink, he gets his own food and we leave.\n\n We are driving and I'm about to eat the quesadilla and he takes a huge Ass chunk of it and is like \"this is your payment for me driving you\" (I'm like whatever he does this crap all the time) \n\nit's probably 10:20 and we are driving and he asks \"where do you want to go next?\" And I say \"home, I gotta be there at 10:30\" and he says \"that doesn't matter, let's go to Wal-Mart\" \n\nThere is no talking him out of it, we are going to Wal-Mart. We go in and do absolutely nothing for about 30 minutes. Finally we leave, I was supposed to be home 20 minutes ago.

I wanna say it was maybe 25 something degrees and I had nothing for protection except a hoodie.\n\nI was supposed to be home at 10:30 and at the time it was probably 11:30 so my mom was calling me telling me I need to get home now. I just told her we were driving home.\n\nThe part about him being fast was a major lie, about 30 minutes in, things got crazy, apparently a dude robbed a house not too long ago and they were trying to find him with a search helicopter and it is going right over this neighborhood. It was getting super close to me and I thought \"I didn't do anything but what if it sees me and I get in trouble for loitering or they could think I was the robber.\" the spotlight from the helicopter was about a dozen feet away and I decided \"Fuck it, let's get under a car\" so I do. The helicopter flies away and I get back up.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later (about 11:45) that ho gets out of his car and I get back in trying to warm up because it was so cold outside. I told him what happened and that I need to be home right now. He is driving super fast and we get home, my mom and dad are pissed. I tell him it's his fault and that's that.\n\nAll of that happened Friday night this is what happened today (Monday)\n\nHe was telling our other friend \"yeah man, I got some head\" then I said \"yeah, while I was outside freezing my Ass off.\" Then he kinda laughed and said \"dude you could have just stayed in the backseat.\" (He was serious) I told him, \"that chick would never blow you with me in the backseat\" and he is just kinda like \"yeah she would, whatever\"\n\nHe brings up the robbery part and he changes up the whole story so it makes it sound like I'm a complete idiot. It kinda went something like this \"yeah, Cody was just outside and a cop car comes down the street and he hides under a car, Cody your so stupid\" after all this I was about to snap.\n\nI TRY to correct him. I say \"it was a search helicopter\" and he interrupts every word I say like a child. Then he says \"either way, your fuckin stupid.\" I keep telling my story and I say \"what would happen if the helicopter saw me?

She sat me down and said she just did not love me, and she did not want to live out our \"suburban life\" that we had planned. \n\nSome context:  I was 26 she was 24 at the time, we were married at 24 and 22, and had been married for just over 2 years when she decided this.  We both grew up in a smaller town in Illinois, went to the same college, and got married just after graduating.  We dated each other a total of 3 years before we got married, so it's not like we just rushed into things, in my opinion.  \n\nWe moved out of the small town less than a year after getting married to a large suburb just outside of Chicago.  I had secured a job in the town we moved to, and not long after moving my wife found a great job in Chicago, which was a decent commute on the train every day.  Instantly our lives were very different, we went from seeing each other every day for breakfast and most of our evenings, to me dropping her off at the train in the wee morning hours and picking her up usually after dinner.  She started spending more and more time in the city going out with her coworkers and friends, and complaining that she had no friends or things to do in the suburbs where we lived.  \n\nWell we ended up finding a great deal on a house in the suburbs and bought it.  This was in November of 2013.  We purchased it for 100,000 with a 5,000 down-payment that I paid out of my personal IRA (a special rule allows for first time homeowners to use IRA money penalty free up to 10,000). \n\nAt this time her job started to take off (she is a recruiter for accounting and finance jobs), to the level that it put her on track to make $150,000 in 2014.  I make approximately 47,000 at my job, and it is salaried, no commission will increase it like hers.\n\nAnyway, she decided in February that she no longer wanted to be together which started a long period of me begging her not to leave, and her saying she had made up her mind and there was nothing that was going to change that.  \n\nI felt it was fishy at the time, I had not treated her poorly or done anything I felt was worthy of being divorced over, but she assured me she just wasn't happy with where her life was going and wanted to try something different.  \n\nIn May of 2014 she moved into an apartment in Chicago with a few girls, and as of next week we will be officially divorced.  I tried to reconcile multiple times over the last 10 months, but to no avail.\n\nAll of this is important because when she split she said I could have the house, as it is not paid off, I will have the benefit of keeping the house, but will incur the mortgage myself.  By the time she left we had paid off $23,000 in total, including the $5,000 down payment.   Two days ago she e-mailed me and stated that I needed to refinance and take out an additional $10,000 that is owed to her for half of what was paid on the house.\n\nI do not think I owe her anything, she was living in the house and still married while we were paying on it, and she made the decision to leave.  So i'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for not wanting to give her that money?

(I have since gone to therapy and cleaned up my act). During this time, I was sometimes difficult to be around. I'd make plans and cancel last minute (or would be super late) because I'd have a breakdown and didn't want to go out all puffy from crying. She was always a bit abrasive, but at that point in my life I figure I deserved it for jerking her around. \n\nSince then (about 5 years ago), she moved across the country, came out as trans, and comes to visit once or twice a year. She got a fantastic job out there and makes 6 figures. She bought a house, a dog, and a new BMW so she could take her old lexus apart and convert it to electric. Meanwhile, me and my SO of 10+ yrs are still living in a crappy apartment and barely making rent. I'm a little jealous, but I actually like my life now and I'm mostly happy (a huge step up from where I was 10 years ago).\n\n---------------------\n**Now for the meat of the story:**\n\nMy SO started a startup that mostly crashed and burned. Zee loaned him some money to get it off the ground (about 20,000). It was supposed to be a short term loan, but shit happened (including an employee that embezzled ~ $25,000) and it hasn't gotten paid back. She's said it was cool (she makes 6 figures and is *by no means* in financial trouble) and that we could pay her back when it wouldn't be a burden to do so. She told us to \"think of it as a gift\" and that she didn't expect us to pay her back.\n\nSince then, we've dug the company out a bit and things are looking up (got a contract with a national chain! Yay!), but we've still been working our asses off and barely making rent (950 a month); All four of us in the company have been threatened with eviction in the past year. We're not starving, but it wouldn't take much to put us under, even now.\n\nZee came to visit us this week. We were attending an event that we all make a point to go to together. It's expensive for us (hotel and such), but we (mostly I) save up and have a good time. We (me and SO) shared a hotel room with Zee to cut costs and some other friends of ours drove up. \n\nThe SO (without talking to me or Zee) offered to let our friends crash on our bed and get me and him a cot from the front desk. I was a little miffed by this because last year we were supposed to split a hotel with these friends, but they fucked off and left us with the bill (which is a lot for us). So now I'm supposed to smile and let them stay for free this year? >:(\n\nThis is where I do a stupid thing. I go and have lunch with Zee and mildly vent about the hotel nonsense. She then tells me \"**You shouldn't complain because [my SO] hasn't paid her back yet\".**\n\nNow me and the SO have separate finances, and I am not really involved in the start up (though I try to help out anyway). I don't get paid by said start up, and I had no part in the loan between her and my SO. Furthermore, she invested in a *start up* and anyone can tell you that any such investment carries some risk. And to top it all off, she's in no way hurting from this, and for him to pay her back (even 100$ a month) would bankrupt us and probably end up with all four of us in the company being homeless. So I'm pretty pissed about this, but I swallow my feelings and try to defend him gently, saying that we'd get her her money as soon as we could. And I even apologize for being grumpy and venting to her. But she didn't back off at all.  I let it go and try to have a good time, but 24 hrs later and back at my apartment (where she is staying with us) I'm even more upset about it.\n\n\n***Am I the asshole for being upset about this?***\n\nShould I just let it go? Should I tell my SO? Should I fess up to the SO and tell her and him that I don't want her coming to visit anymore?

At 73(?) years old, she's taken ill with a chronic respiratory condition that requires her to be on oxygen all the time.  She needs assistance with some tasks, but (by her doctor's advisement) is capable of accomplishing most tasks independently.  For now.\n\nMore background:  my mother is a certified narcissist. She only cares about herself, and everyone else she considers her \"loved ones\" are there to support her and give her life structure and connection. She has always wanted only to be taken care of by the people around her.  \n\nAs far as her health, my mother ignores doctor's advice, and cancels appointments at whim. We encourage her to be independent and active (key aspects of living successfully at any age, but particularly at her age), but she is argumentative, and refuses to do anything to help herself.  We offer support (logistically) when we can, but it's extremely frustrating to deal with her, for these reasons and more.\n\nShe was abusive (physically and emotionally) to my sister and I our whole childhood and mentally/emotionally cruel on through young adulthood and beyond.  She was unable to help us at any stage of our life, and worse, she was a detriment to our lives for the most part.  She is a horrible person who just assumed someone would step up to take her in.  Our relationship is, at best, strained.  My mother and father separated when we were young, and she never remarried.  She has pushed away her family, and lives too far for them to be of help, even if they wanted to.  She has had money, but largely squandered it away through various bad decisions.  \n\nMy sister and I live alone, and live outside the city she lives in.  We don't have the means to be the caretaker for her--even if we wanted to, which we don't.  I feel guilty about it all the time, because I think most people SHOULD help their parents out if they can.  The fact that she has no retirement money is really the last straw for us. No life insurance money, no final expense coverage, nothing.  She is smug and matter-of-fact about it, like \"what did you guys think?\"  Maybe we should have seen it coming.  But we have our own lives to live, and we she'll have to deal with whatever care agencies are available, and then a government-run nursing home when she's not capable of caring for herself.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be stuck with this problem?? \n\n", "score": 46, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "2xvoy8", "name": "t3_2xvoy8", "created_utc": 1425448613.0, "title": "how much of an asshole am I? tale of two women, though not officially committed to either.", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "comments": [{"id": "cp3zal1", "body": "Sorry, but I think you're in the wrong here.

Whether we're at home sitting on the couch or eating dinner together at a restaurant or just generally talking to one another, sometimes I'll start to talk and I notice that she isn't actually paying attention. Here are some of the signs:\n\n1. She's facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she's looking at, all the while saying, \"mhmm, yeah... uh huh\"\n2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. \"OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.\"\n3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.\n\nAnd the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.\n\nNow I'm not an attention whore by any means. I've learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn't even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I've gotten used to it by now, so I'll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I'll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, \"Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don't.\"\nOr I'll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like \"Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it's not even important. How was your day?\"\n\nAnd now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She interrupts me mid sentence and says:\n\nGF: \"Honey don't we know those two people from somewhere?\"\n\nMe: \"I dunno\" and just stopped talking\n\nGF: \"Sorry, what were you saying?\" \n\nMe: \"Nothing, never mind\"\n\nGF: \"I said sorry, jeez. Why are you always like this?\"\n\nMe: \"What? I'm just not going to waste my energy talking when you don't care.\"\n\nGF: \"What's your problem?\"\n\nMe: \"Nothing, I'm just tired of being interrupted and ignored. Don't you think it's rude to do that? I always listen to you and anyone else that talks to me because I actually care, but sometimes you just don't care, so I don't care either.\"\n\nGF: \"Relax, I just wanted to know if you knew who they were. Why do you have to be so sensitive about this all the time? I'm listening to you.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, so what was I talking about then?\"\n\nGF: \"Fine, whatever.\"\n\nThis has happened to me all my life because my family has always ignored me. Thus, I've always been courteous to other people by doing something as simple as listening to them when they talk. My girlfriend's closest friend and cousin is exactly like this and I've actually had arguments with them in the past about this type of thing being disrespectful to the person talking to you but they think it's trivial.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

We enjoy talking to each other a lot, so we want the other to watch/read/play stuff so we can talk about it.\n\nThe problem is that my brother is incredibly flakey about trying things that I want him to try, even though he'll still find new things to try on his own.\n\nA few years back, I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and loved it. And I knew he would love it to. So I asked him to read it. He said he would later when he felt like it. At that time, the situation I just described wasn't really in place, so I didn't think much of it. Still, it was often at the back of my head that he still hadn't.\n\nA few months ago *at least* two years later, he decided to read it. And it was only because he decided to use it for a school project. Excuse me if I think that gives him a bit of a poor record.\n\nRight now, I can think of 11 things I want him to do. And I am certain there are more. I'd like it if he could finish the Hitchhiker's Guide series (since he only read the first 1 or 2), play 5 videogames (though I think I lost one, so maybe 4), read 4 webcomics, and watch 1 short webseries. He has done none of those things. Some have been things I wanted him to do for years, while some are more recent.\n\nIn the last few years, despite the fact that there have been many things I've asked him to do, he has still started a bunch of things on his own. Scratch that, he's gone actively looking for them. Yet, every single thing I want him to do, he says he'll get to \"sometime, when he feels like it.\" I'm pretty sure that's going to be never.\n\nRecently, I did get him to play a videogame. And he *really, really* like it. It was Fire Emblem: Awakening. But of course, he had to take a good thing and turn it into a bad thing. It started with one playthrough. Then it turned into one, but with frequent delays where he started the game again to test things out and do them differently. Now it's his original playthrough that is still unfinished, one on Lunatic difficulty that he's still far from getting through, and a promise of *another* one once he's done where he will min/max character stats. Basically, it's turned into a gigantic waste of time. He spends a ridiculous amount of time playing it, and yet he still seems to go through at a snail's pace. I don't even care about it anymore. \n\nI've gotten him to read the beginnings of all the webcomics I want him to read. For each one, he's thought they were pretty good. And even said that he'll probably read them. He has yet to read any. A couple I've been waiting for for years, the other two for months. He still isn't getting around to it. And what bothers me the most is that he literally does nothing all day.\n\nI'm serious. He's already gone down the rabbit hole of staying up too late every night and taking naps during the afternoon. But he just spends hours each day accomplishing so little. Today, he's made a new Mii Fighter in Smash Bros., then proceeded to literally screw around with it, just running around on stages doing nothing, for hours. He's currently rewatching an episode of a show he's already seen. He also spends a long time checking reddit (even though he still insists he's not really a redditor), checking a forum (and he refreshes it once every ten minutes), and just randomly rereading comics and blog posts he's already seen. He literally thinks about how bored he is, then thinks of some random thing he's already done that he can do, and does it for dozens of minutes. And yet it never occurs to him to do one of the things I want him to do.\n\nRight now, I've been taking a fairly active approach in trying to get him to read some webcomics. As in, reminding him several times a day that it is a thing he could be doing. He's been getting pretty annoyed about it. Says that it's actively making him *not* want to because of how aggravating it is. And he insists that if I just left him alone, he'd get around to it. I don't care when he says that. Because he's constantly demonstrated that no, he won't. Even if it annoys him, bringing it up often will keep it in his mind. Because it never is if I let him be.\n\nAlso, for a while, we had a thing going where I'd watch/do something he wanted me to do, then he'd return the favor. That system worked pretty well because for a while, we were actually decent about it. We weren't super strict, and we tried to actually return the favor. Until he just straight-up stopped. Not once did he ever do something in exchange for me again. Which, of course, led to me getting a bit more strict about it. And naturally, that led to him saying that he never really agreed to it in the first place. Which would obviously happen, because our system was never really meant for strict exchanges. It only worked because we were reasonable. But of course he'd start saying that once I had watched a ton of things he wanted me to watch, with nothing from him.\n\nHe admittedly does do a better job of asking once, then just letting me be. But I feel like that's because I've been much more willing to do things for him. When he asks me to do something and I say I don't feel like it, that's usually meant that I'll do it the next day. And I usually have. But when I ask him to do something and he says he doesn't feel like it, that usually means he's never going to do it. And 97% of the time, he hasn't.\n\nAm I the asshole for bugging him a lot about reading some webcomics?\n\nSorry if I was just rambling or it didn't make sense.\n\nEDIT: Another thing he does is maybe give something a shot *once*, then try dangling that over my head forever. With one webcomic, the one he had the best chance of reading, he once read about 14 pages on his own. Then proceeded to do nothing for weeks/months. But if I bring it up, he always claims he *does* get to things even though it's basically an outlier.", "score": 7, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "303lfk", "name": "t3_303lfk", "created_utc": 1427171928.0, "title": "AITA for wanting my roommate to replace my computer screen?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "So recently my roommate shot my computer screen with an airsoft gun.

Does he chew on stuff, if they started feeling allergic, if he was to loud, and so on.\n\n\n\nNow today is the first day that we had the dog. I let my roommates know that he would be coming sometime this week, my roommate comes in and asks if this is the start of the long time we would have him, I tell her yes. And she flips out and tells me that she doesn't think that it will work and that she thought we were going to talk about it. I tell her that I explicitly said to them that they needed to tell me if there were any problems during the one week we had him so that if it was something we could fix that we could get it taken care of; and if it was something we couldn't fix then my friend and I could find him somewhere else to live. She is instant that she is allergic to him and I just tell her that she should have told me earlier. That way we could have found some place different. \n\n\n\nI eventually told her that I would try to find someplace for him so that she didn't get to uptight, but until I do he has to stay with us.

These are pinned up in the managers office, the staff office and there's a copy behind the CSD. Anyone who wants to check their shifts (or needs to) can go and consult any of these copies at any time. \n  \nA few weeks ago, M asked me on a Friday afternoon if I could cover a Saturday shift, to which I said no. I found it totally unreasonable that I was being expected to cover a shift with less than 12 hours notice, and I wasn't particularly happy that her 'reason' for wanting that day off was 'because I promised my little girl we'd go shopping'. To me, the shift timetable had been up for long enough that if it had been that important, she would have spoken to the line manager and asked not to be put in a shift that day (which is entirely possible, I've done it). I told her this in a polite fashion and advised her gently that if she had availability issues, she needed to go to a manager and actually tell them. \n\n  Skip forward to last two days ago and she seems to be pulling the same thing again. I'm now covering her shift today for what appears to be similar reasons, and I'm not happy as this was supposed to be the start of 4 days of holiday for me. \n\nNow fair enough, things like childcare are an issue, and I can understand if some genuine reason to do with the kids or whatever is an issue, but to me the whole thing looks like she's using this as a trump card, and I'm being expected to give into every demand. magically virtually every other person with children in the store seems to cope just fine. \n\nSo, AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I should add in addition to these two examples, she has done this quite a few times.

Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be concise. \n\nI own and run a company together with three male partners. I'm the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn't realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: \"Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?\" And then proceeded to bark in that partner's face like an angry dog.\n\nI caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn't immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn't realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.\n\nNow, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it's in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven't spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can't let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.\n\nOK, so here's the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it's starting to show in our daily interactions. I don't really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn't say friendly, and the frequency of our conversations has dropped. And when he interrupts me now, I just keep on talking and bulldoze right over him. This especially has made him notice that something is going on, but since the incident happened a few weeks ago, he has no idea what he did wrong. \n\nI should add that I was brought on board explicitly to add structure/professionalism to the company. We work in a creative field and before I joined the team, it was kind of a crazy, non-productive free-for-all. I've been fairly successful in implementing discipline, but it's been a long and hard fight... Which has resulted in my being labelled as the company nag.

I answer the phone in a small office and I suffer through easily 20 calls a day by robo-dialing pollsters, telemarketers in call centers, and individual salesmen cold-calling to offer something that is completely unwanted but a company like mine might use.  \n\nPersonally, I think what telemarketers do is save money and enrich themselves at the expense of the general public.  Sure, each individual occurrence is too small to criminalize or prosecute, but a multitude of them can make it unreasonably expensive to pay a staff to answer your business line, or make it insane for useful officers of a business to be reachable directly by phone.  Whether or not there is a Do No Call list, it should be illegal in all forms.  \n\nI have never bought the argument that you shouldn't be rude to them because the person on the phone just needs the money and it's really the boss who should suffer.  Yes, the boss should suffer, but when I think something is wrong, I don't take a job doing it.  I think it's wrong to kick puppies, and if someone offered me $15/hr to kick puppies, I wouldn't do it.

Once an individual has redialed enough to have ignored at least one civil request to remove me from the dialing list and later become recognizable to me by voice, I am openly hostile and aggressive to them.

Am I a bad girlfriend for no longer making an effort to be friends when my boyfriend really wants everyone to get along? I used to be friendly but now I'm just civil and nothing more unless she talks first.**\n\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend John for a month. His flatmate, Jane, is a good friend of his who he works with. When Johns ex dumped him Jane offered her house to him. She insisted that he not pay any rent and they agreed that he stay for roughly a month. That was in January. \n\n\nWhen John first moved in Jane jumped him on the couch and tried to kiss him and initiate sex. John politely turned her down because he doesn't believe in sleeping with flatmates/coworkers. I'm honestly fine with this - I can understand being attracted to John :) I didn't even meet him until a month later. **I do not do anything \"couply\" with John in front of her. I have never kissed him or told him I liked him in front of her**. \n\n\nJane and I were friendly at first but then she started becoming extremely passive aggressive. She suddenly refused to talk to either of us and would sometimes demand that we leave the house at 11pm because she \"wanted space\" and we couldn't come back until the next day... And even then John had to come back alone. On our first night as a couple she got drunk and started screaming on the phone at her friend about how much she hated John and wanted to live alone - she did this from like 8m away and knew we could hear her. I'm very conservative and shy around strangers so on the rare occasion she talks to me she likes to push subjects to try and make me uncomfortable, such as telling me to wear nipple tassels with her and discussing my breasts (her boyfriend I barely knew was next to her). \n\n\nNow, I'm of the belief that whoever has the house makes the rules so we should just shut up and deal with it until John finds a new place. The thing is, I only visit once a week and Jane always holds that over Johns head. He has tried to pay her rent several times and each time Jane refuses but then tries to control him by saying \"no you can't do this/have your girlfriend visit because you don't pay any rent\". He always pays utilities though. Jane has also told John multiple times that she doesn't mind that he stay longer despite the initial agreement only being for a month. \n\n\nEvery time Jane does something bad she apologises later and says she knows she's being unreasonable but then she goes and does it again. \n\n\nJohn has been applying for new houses every day but been unsuccessful because our city has a huge housing crisis. Jane is still insisting that it's fine that he stay with her until then and that it's okay if I visit once a week (she always says it's fine but complains later, saying that she hates my laugh or she wanted space). \n\n\nAfter this, I never ask to visit John unless John and Jane ask me. I have never been anything but polite to Jane's face (although I've told John I can't understand why he wants to be friends with someone who controls him when he's 27) and everytime I come over I smile genuinely and greet her but now neither of us bother with conversation. \n\n\n**I'm NOT after a solution (obviously he needs to move out or I need to stop visiting when she says it's okay), I just want to know if I'm an asshole for not bothering to try and make things up to Jane when it's only been a measly month, considering he still wants to stay friends with her (everyone says she has a really nice side that I haven't seen) and I think girlfriends should always make an effort to be nice to people their boyfriends care about.**\n\nJohns abusive ex refused to meet his friends and family. When she finally met his friends at a work function she left without telling him because she was bored. He was humiliated. A year later she finally met his mother and constantly complained about how she was forced to be there and even left early alone to catch a 2hr bus to the airport to get home - they were only visiting for two days.

I said no, told him to fuck off and to not talk to me again. of course he tried to say it was a test but I just ignored him from then on. He tried to spit on me once, I ignored him then too.

She's 21 and we attend the same community college. \n\nI have never in all my fucking life heard anyone talk of grief, pain, and suffering the way this chick can. I'm supposed to be a good person so the first time she sat down next to me in the cafeteria and told me she had \"no one else to talk to about this\", I told her of course I'd listen. Well, *of course*, she immediately starts blubbering, carrying on like a Jewish widow. Cerebral palsy, autoimmune disease, abuse, rape, *pain, pain, pain.*\n\nThe first time, I really did listen and felt sorry for her. But after at least 20 fucking encounters like this- and I've only known her 6 months!- I just can't take it anymore. Yes, she had a traumatic surgery. And yes, she has an autoimmune disease that means she's sick six days out of seven. And yes, she's pretty sure she's gonna die before the year's out. Well, it's not *my* fault she was born 3 months early, now is it? Yes, it's gotta be hard being that sick all the time, but it isn't easy listening to it almost every goddamn day, either!!\n\nI am so through with her. So you got sucked into an abusive relationship WHILE YOU WERE DATING SOMEONE ELSE?? Eventually you've gotta buck up and stop living in the past. I've heard her talk about how she was violated and then sent to a mental hospital so many times I can literally recite it word for word. I heard you the first time. I didn't need to hear the other fucking 19. \n\nSure, life hasn't been kind to her. But that's just the way it is. Everything happens for some kind of purpose in the end. And no one is going to want to help you or care when all you do is sit on your fucking bed and cry about it ALL. DAY. LONG! You tell me about your issues with self-harm and that you occasionally starve yourself. So what? Every college girl goes without eating to lose weight. You're not fucking special. Eventually, you're gonna have to look on the bright side, or no one's going to like you. I would be completely amazed if you had other friends besides me.

I mean, what the hell do you even say to that? I hold her hand and tell her it's gonna be okay and I even fucking googled a suicide hotline for her. But no matter how many goddamn times I reassure her, she always comes back. Surgery, PTSD, abusive relationships, sickness, panic attacks, cutting, on and on and *fucking on*. It never ends with this bitch. It's like talking to a brick wall.\n\nThis whole being someone's source of support when they're in need and vulnerable sounds all fuzzy-wuzzy, but trust me, it isn't. Hello, Bitch! You have some chronic disorders! Lots of people do! Get over it! And so a surgery scared you. Surgeries aren't fun, that's life. And so your exes were all abusive.

Not my problem,\" to the teacher and everyone else.\n\nOccasionally, she'll beg me for help when she sees me helping my sister, to which I will look her dead in the eyes and say, \"Do it yourself for once.\" This doesn't happen a lot, but it has happened before.

I got up and the conversation went something like this:\n\n*For further clarification, the house we live in is shit. The tumble dryer is located on top of the washing machine, and no matter how hard we try, the thing will rattle and push itself up against the wall outside my door, and shake into the wall constantly until it is finished.

Can you put the underwear you need dried out to air tonight, and then use the tumble dryer in the morning? It'll be dry by the morning.\"  \n**Upstairs room-mate:** \"No, it needs to be dried in this tumble dryer.\"  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo she proceeds to start it for 50 minutes, and goes upstairs. I turn it off as soon as she leaves, and get back into bed. A minute or so later, I hear her come down and start it again. I go outside and so begins the argument where she says that I can keep turning it off, but she will continue to turn it on again. Eventually, I decide to just let her win and I lay awake for the entire time the dryer is banging against my wall. \n\nCut to 6.30am, and I hear her come downstairs and run the machine AGAIN for another half an hour. Now I'm completely sure this was out of spite. I get up, go to turn off the dryer and suddenly a great idea comes to me. I locate the fuse box in the house and flick the switch which controlled the power to the sockets.

It worked for a while, but we were cuddling this morning and he pressed his head against my ear unintentionally. I said \"Ouch, you touched my piercings\" which sent him in sulk mode all over again.

They waived our application fees, and let my friend and I split a $600 pet fee/deposit since we have two small pets (two 15lb dogs) making it $300 per person in pet fee/deposit. We move in in May! (except for one guy, he moves in August) w/ rent @ $409 a month.\n\nJanuary rolls around and I went ahead and paid $1936 (4 months rent plus pet fee/deposit) in advance for May through August. About a month before we were supposed to move in, I called to ask what apartment number I was supposed to go, or when that info would be available for us. They said they'd call and let us know about 2 weeks before move in. All righty! Two weeks before move in I call and say hey, we were wondering if you guys knew which apartment number yet and this person said well, we will just tell you what apartment you have when you get here, we don't normally call people and tell them two weeks in advance.\n\nI kind of start to get annoyed here, but it's not bad by any means. It's just I'm not going to move somewhere without knowing what apartment number beforehand. What if I was moving a considerable distance? What if I get there and they forgot? It just didn't seem okay to me, but maybe I was being picky/bitchy about it. My friend called back and asked the same thing, this time finding out we could fill out a maintenance request and find out. \n\nAbout 2 days later we find the apartment number out, so my friend and I go there and find the building, walk around etc to check it out. The door was open because they had just painted/were working on the apartment so we peeked in but din't walk in. The floors were pretty dirty, and the stove was yellowed-old. We were kind of upset, but I told my friend ya know maintenance is clearly still working on this place so let's wait till we move in before we get upset about anything over nothing. The next day another one of our friends says hey, the door is unlocked so I went and checked it out-- so naturally I went and checked it out too but I only had about 5 minutes and my main focus was bedrooms (we hadn't picked yet). They had replaced the stove but it was still an older model (looks pretty much new but the lettering is worn off the burner knobs and it's a much older model of stove with no clock or timer etc). I didn't notice much else about the apartment, it was towards the end of the day with low light and like say I was in a rush. Again, I'm thinking they've still got 2-3 days before we move in so we'll wait and see.\n\nThey call us the day before we move in at like 6PM and say hey, you're going to have to wait until 1PM to move in so maintenance can do one last check over on the apartment. I mean, you guys are kind of taking half a day away from me but if maintenance is working hard to make sure that bitch is right, so be it, I understand. May is a weird time of year to move in college students.\n\nWe get there next day, get our keys, and start moving in. The place wasn't really... fully cleaned. There are paint spots and scuffs all over the flooring, dust and shit-- we're going to have to totally clean the floors. No icemaker in the fridge, porch light doesn't work, one of the bathroom light switches doesn't work, an air vent is really loose (And it's right above a desk so like, it's pretty dangerous), and the only upgrade here is the flooring really. Like, what the hell? The door to the bedroom I wanted is locked, so we go back to the office and ask if we can get it unlocked and they say yeah, maintenance will come by sometime today to get it. Well I mean fuck, I already had to wait till 1PM and I'm really pissed off at this point. I go back and talk to my mom about it, my concern being that I might just be super bitchy/nitpicky because I'm pretty stressed over finals and she's like fuck no let me go talk to them. My mom is really loud and firm. It's super intimidating and she comes off like a total bitch if you don't know her.\n\nWe go down to the office again and she's like \"Yeah, I wanna speak to a manager now.\" Meantime, another friend is there getting her keys to the new apartment as well. The property manager comes out and starts asking whats wrong and my mom starts forcefully explaining. At the same time, there's confusion for my friend getting the keys, she is the roommate that also has a dog so when she goes to write a check for first months rent they are like \"yeah, the pet fee is $600\" and we explained that the property manager let us half it. We find out then that the property manager that signed us on has been fired, and left no record of that agreement (Our lease was supposed to be changed to reflect that but it never was). The new property manager says she will \"honor the agreement\" though I didn't think that was a very big deal considering that was what was supposed to happen anyways-- you're not exactly doing me a favor here lady (and remember, I've already paid this pet fee/deposit so I have a receipt to prove it not to mention like 5 witnesses on the verbal agreement). The new property manager comes down with us to the apartment to check out all the issues. As soon as she walks in she says \"Ohhh, this is a partially upgraded unit.\" We start feeling a lot better because it's like oh all right, so it's not that no one gave a shit, it's just the wrong type of apartment (there was no previous mention of partially upgraded apartments, and still isn't on their official paperwork. We asked for the fully upgraded model so it'd be just like the one we toured because we really liked it). She says she will lets us have this apartment at a regular apartment rate of $384 per month to make up for it (so $25/month less but we get upgraded flooring) plus she will help us make sure everything is fixed, etc. We all reluctantly agree (super tired from moving, it's finals week, and I'm sick) that something like that will probably work since none of us want to move again.\n\nThat night we go check out a friends apartment (same apartment complex) and they have the true regular apartment. It's the same price $384/month but doesn't have the upgraded flooring and thats literally it. though, they have cushioned bar chairs which we would really like (ours aren't cushioned) since we plan on using the bar a lot. The condition otherwise is about the same, but again, our upgraded floors are dirty, covered in paint speckles, and scuffed quite a bit.\n\nWe continue moving and find other details like one of the bedroom doors is totally broken and doesn't shut/wiggles like a pool noodle, the freshly painted walls were painted pretty lazily (you can tell they just painted over dust etc, marks on walls, dent/scuffs here and there-- not bad looking walls by any means though). After a night's sleep, we get up saturday and start moving lots of shit, and got a lot done. Feeling a bit better about it all, we get another nights rest and we are all feeling really good about it Sunday. Friends are heading back to work/studying for finals and I start unpacking my room. I quickly discover the internet absolutely sucks. It's included with the apartment but their website literally says \"Fastest Internet In \"the city\" Has Just Landed At \"the apartment complex\" \" so when I run speed test and pull a sweet, savory 6 Mbps (my max rated speed, with intermittent 100Mbps \"boosts\" as needed) I'm more than pissed off. I'm ready to break my lease pissed off. It's physically impossible to watch 1080p video continuously with this connection. I'm an electrical engineering student and do a LOT on my computer, I had hoped on living here for the next 2-4 years and I literally/physically can't with internet like that. We debate looking at buying an internet package through comcast or something and splitting it but agree if we have to do that we will be demanding a deduction from our rent since we aren't using their internet because it's literally unbearable. However, I note to everyone that I'm super pissed and tired and probably much more bitchy than I should be about it all. I made a list of everything that needed to be fixed, that we were promised, and how we felt about it all together so I could go talk to the property manager today (we haven't worked out resigning the leases yet so I needed to stop by anyways).\n\nThis morning, I felt all right. Still pretty upset over the internet, but overall decent. I head down to the office planning on having a 10-15 minute chat with the manager about all our things and it ends up being more like 2 minutes. She tells me I'll have to do a maintenance request on all the broken things in the apartment, we can't do anything about the internet, we can't switch out our bar chairs and we they'll remake the lease and we can come sign it at our convenience. Now, the internet is much better today so I don't feel nearly as bad, and if it stays this good I'll be happy but other residents are saying it's pretty much shit all the time. Honestly, here's how we felt:\n\n* There's a new property manager, the other one got fired for whatever bad thing, and May is a weird time for us to move in, we get that.\n\nHowever...\n\n* This apartment is not what we signed a lease for, not fully cleaned, clearly not checked over (it feels like they forgot we were moving in to be honest and just threw some shit together) and there are a lot of little things adding on to the pile of disappointment and frustration.\n\nAs far as we're concerned, this apartment complex has broken this lease with us, and that's rude/insulting/maybe illegal and wants us to just accept the apartment at a slightly lower price and be quiet about it like we owe them something. We feel like they need to make it up to us more than that. I'll be honest, we like the apartment pretty well. I mean for $384 a month, it's pretty bitchin'. Though, there is an almost identical apartment literally a mile away (their main competitor) that has the same pricing and amenities but they are brand new (though they don't allow pets, which sucks). But even if we wanted to go there we can't now, because we expected this apartment to work out (not to mention tired from moving, finals, sick, etc as well as most apartments have their leases filled out now). So ultimately, we're fucking stuck here.\n\nTyping this out has been really helpful for me, I think, just to lay it all out somewhere and especially if anyone care to read through this huge fuckin' wall of text and give me your much valued opinion.\n\nAt this point we'd feel fantastic about it all if they:\n\n* Fix the broken shit (this has to fucking happen)\n* Pay to have these floors cleaned (I'm pretty firm on this happening)\n* Switch the bar stools we want (I'm pretty firm on this happening)\n* Updated stove (This would be nice, though the stove is already nice so it's not a huge deal)\n* Do something about the slow internet (whether it be let us get our own and deduct from our rent or upgrade the existing Pavlov shit)\n\nWe feel like this isn't really too unreasonable, things considering, but I would love to see other people's opinion before I send my property manager an email about it. I haven't gone over this for clarity/typos, so apologies for that.

My friends frequently bring this up as a time when I was an \"asshole\"\n\nSo, two friends and I arrive at a diner and sit in the waiting area. We're waiting for a fourth friend. We're just talking about this and that, not being loud or rude or anything. Eventually, the manager walks in and asks if we insulted an old couple that had just walked in. We honestly didn't and said so, but it was clear he didn't believe us. So, we were a little miffed at the start but we were allowed to get a table anyway\n\nWe sit down. I look at the menu. I dislike cheeseburgers and the last time I was at this diner, I ordered a burger but got a cheeseburger instead. I wanted to make sure this didn't happen again. This is what the menu looked like:\n\nAll American Burger (cheese is listed as a topping as well as lettuce and tomato and it comes with a side)\n\nCheeseburger\n\nCowboy Burger\n\nSeveral more complicated burgers\n\nPlain burger (no cheese, lettuce, tomato, or side)\n\nI glanced at the burger section of the menu and didn't even look down at the bottom because I naturally assumed the burgers would get more and more complicated. This is where the interaction with the waitress takes place\n\nI asked for an \"All American Burger without cheese.\" She got very confused\n\n\"Wait? No cheese?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"It's a cheeseburger\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't like cheese. I'd like a hamburger\"\n\n\"So you just want the burger and nothing on it?\" \n\nI knew my response to this would be critical because this is usually where a misunderstanding happens. I didn't want to end up getting a patty without a bun or lettuce or tomato. So, I responded:\n\n\"I want the burger, buns, lettuce, and tomato\"\n\n\"So the All American Burger without cheese?\"\n\n(This is where I got a little short with her)\n\n\"Yes, that's why I said it\"\n\nAnyway, she was still confused because I essentially ordered a cheeseburger without cheese (even though it's listed as a burger on the title...) and she instead suggested that I get the plain burger and ask for lettuce and tomato as toppings. I just wanted to be done with it so I settled on that and didn't get a side (and I didn't say it, but I was confused as to how a burger with two extra toppings was less complicated than asking for a burger with one less)\n\nMy friends tell me I was rude when she left. A little later, my milkshake comes. It's overflowing. I'm not over-exaggerating. She brought it with a stack of napkins so it didn't get on the table and it was dripping on every side. I didn't like the milkshake anyway so I just gave it to my friend, but I was still a little miffed\n\nAnyway, we eventually get our food and *I apologize for the earlier misunderstanding.* She says it's fine and that she knows the menus can be confusing sometimes. We finish our meals, I tip her, we leave\n\nMy friends still cite this incident as the time where I was a dick to a waitress, but I honestly don't think I was. I was just trying to take precautions so my order didn't get messed up and I feel like compared to what other customers she probably gets on a daily basis, I was fine. In all honesty, I think my friends are upset because we spent a lot of the dinner talking about an anime and they were arguing with me because I said I hated an episode of it\n\n**TL;DR: I had a bad experience at a restaurant before, tried to make sure it didn't happen again, get called an asshole even though I apologized and tipped well**", "score": 12, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "34xo03", "name": "t3_34xo03", "created_utc": 1430829533.0, "title": "AITA for being upset my ldgf is shortening our weekly date night so she can take a nap?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "comments": [{"id": "cqz344x", "body": "Yup, back off a bit.

I am a 22yr old male about to graduate college. This happened yesterday, mothers day, at work. I work at a restaurant in downtown chicago, and for those of you who don't know, mothers day is our second busiest day of the year, so I already wasn't in the best mood.  \n\nI work with my roommate and my girlfriend, me and my roommate work in the same section, and my girlfriend works as a hostess on the other side of the restaurant. There are 3 other important people in this story, coworker 1 (C1), coworker 2 (C2), and chef. \n\n\nSo now to actually start the story. It was a hectic day at work and we had two new people working, which just made matters worse. When I first showed up I saw my roommate and gf whispering to each other, saying something like \"did you tell him yet?\". Me, knowing they were talking about me, asked them what they were talking about, and they just changed the subject. This happened about 1-2 more times that day, but I just kicked it to the back of my mind, as that day was very busy\n\n I could go into all the garbage I went through at work that day, but I will skip it to be concise. Basically, I wasn't in the best of moods at this time, but things were dying down and I was looking forward to leaving. I went in the back, and C1, my roommate, and the chef were all laughing in the back. When C1 saw me he shouted \"dumbass got her pregnant!\" my roommate then told him \"no she didn't tell him yet!\" At this point I was beginning to get flustered, and the chef and C1 were telling me what I should have done not to get my girlfriend pregnant, with C1 telling me what a big mistake it was when he had a baby at my age.\n\nThey continued to grill me, but I just stood there and took it, as there was someone up front I was helping get food for. I went back up front and took care of the customer, and my mind started racing with thoughts. Is she really pregnant? Why did she tell everyone else first? Needless to say, I start to freak out a bit. The only time me and her had talked about kids is when we talked about how much we don't like and don't want them. So I called her over, and the conversation went like this.\n\nMe: \"So people have been saying some things about you, is there anything you need to tell me?\"\n\nHer: \"Maybe\"\n\n*At this point my heart starts pounding, this isn't looking good*\n\nMe: \"well what does that mean? If you have something to tell me you can just tell me\"\n\nHer: \"not at work\"\n\n*I'm starting to freak the fuck out, the only reason she wouldn't want to tell me at work is if it was something serious.* \n\nMe: \"does it have to do with\" *points to uterus*\n\nHer: \"yes\"\n\n*my eyes grow wide, my hands start shaking, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack*\n\nMe: \"are you pregnant?\"\n\nHer: \" yes, I'm pregnant\"\n\nI take a step back, as my brain starts to process the gravity of what she just said. I feel the adrenaline kicking through my body, I have no idea how to respond. I'm staring at her wide-eyed, when my roommate jumps out from behind the door, and they both scream\" surprise!\". This does not help with my anxiety, as my heart beats faster. My gf then says \" just kidding I wasn't really pregnant!\". My roommate \"yeah we got you!\". My mouth is open, blood is kicking and I cannot make words come out of my mouth. I say,\"I need to be alone right now\". I then go to the bathroom to try and calm down, be alone, and process. This feels like the start to a panic attack, but I calm myself down a little bit and go back up front. \n\nThere was a customer up there looking to place an order and throughout the conversation my words aren't coming out right, and I'm still flustered. When I hand him my pen to sign the check, I bump into him  because I can't controll my hand. I am obviously not calmed down yet. I go to the back and my roommate attacks me. \"Why are you being so weird?\", \"you should have known it was just a joke\", \"quit being a bitch\". To which I respond shut the fuck up, don't tell me how to feel, and you almost gave me a panic attack. He keeps trying to get in my face to force me to calm down, which was making me even more upset, and I tell him to watch upfront because I need to be alone right now, and cool off.\n\nAs I am going towards the bathroom again, my girlfriend intercepts me. \"Did I ever tell you how much I adore you?\" I can still feel the adrenaline pumping through me, and I just stare at her. She goes in to hug me and I am still freaking out, but I try to hug her back, which turns into a weird half hug. She gets upset with me and storms off. \n\nI then go back into the bathroom and cool off for about fifteen minutes, which helps, and then go back to finally finish my shift. I look for my gf to talk this out, but she already went home. Great. now she's mad at me. I later learn that this whole joke was orchestrated by C2, but it was supposed to go like this.\n\nHer: \"why haven't you wished me a happy mothers day?\"\n\nMe: \"why would I?\"\n\nHer:\"because I'm pregnant!\"\n      \"just kidding!\"\n\n When I got off of work, I texted saying sorry that I got upset, but I was so flustered I couldn't say anything. no reply. So tell me, am I the asshole for responding how I did?\n\nTL;DR: coworkers and girlfriend pretend she is pregnant, I almost have a panic attack, turns out they were just kidding.

I have mostly been camped out on the couch. Normally, I am working and my boyfriend has plenty of time alone to masturbate, and I have recently been privy to his habits a little more than I'm used to. I try to be understanding, since I am currently unable to have sex until six weeks postpartum. I am not against masturbation in any way - I masturbate and think it's healthy. I am, unfortunately, slightly bothered by porn use. I don't like to admit it, but it does irk me a little when I know he's whacking it to porn (he gets up in the middle of the night to do it). I have never said anything about it in the past, because I know guys are visual and masturbation is a different, more personal thing than having sex with your partner. He has a very high sex drive. I have also tried to continue being intimate with him and have given him a few blow jobs, maybe two a week or so, since coming home from the hospital. We normally have sex nearly every day. I am exhausted as well as sexually frustrated.\n\nThis morning I had to take the baby to the doctor. He knew this, but he was unsure of the time I was leaving. I was nursing her on the couch and he came out of the bedroom to get the laptop and went back into the bedroom, announcing that he was going to masturbate. This bothered me and I said in a frustrated tone, \"I'm leaving in an hour!\" thinking he could just wait until I left, which would be preferable for me because I don't really like sitting in the adjacent room awake while he masturbates, but also, I thought, to him, because he wouldn't have to feel bad about me sitting out there, he could have the sound on, or whatever.\n\nHe gets upset and I get upset back. I said, angrily, that he could just wait for me to leave and have time to masturbate to his favorite porn star all day! We argue and I leave, and I've been stewing all day about how selfish and insensitive he is. I say that he can be more sensitive to how I feel about him masturbating whenever and wherever since I am sexually frustrated and exhausted taking care of a baby and he says I have no right to tell him when or where to masturbate or what to do with his body. \n\nHe is also stuck on the fact that I don't like porn and is now saying I don't want him to masturbate ever, which isn't true. He says I can't say I don't want him to masturbate in the room next to me while I'm awake and then also say I'm okay with masturbation. He also says since I've never said anything about him masturbating to porn bothering me before that I am a liar and have not been upfront in our relationship. In reality, I have asked him to clear the history because I don't like to see what he masturbates to. I feel my dislike of porn use is irrational, so mostly I ignore it. I have never told him not to use porn and don't expect that from him at all... I just don't like thinking about him jerking it in the room next to me while I'm sitting there!\n\nHopefully this makes some sense - I probably rambled a little too much.

I work for my grandfather's company- he's the CEO and my mother is the general manager. I work in a separate department under a different manager, but my mom oversees everyone so she's ultimately my boss. I've been there 5 years and I cover not only my own job description but a myriad of other duties that I've taken over that fall outside my department, and I report to my mother a lot of the time- so although I answer to my manager as far as our department is concerned, I'm not just an employee, if that makes sense.\n\nMy manager has only been at the company for 6 months. She's a nice enough lady, but she's very distracting. We have a policy against personal phone calls unless its necessary- that's what your breaks are for. Texting isn't a problem as long as work is finished, because it isn't distracting to everyone else like chatting at your desk tends to be. The problem is my manager easily takes 3 or 4 (sometimes more) personal phone calls a day. It's not just quick questions either- the shortest are 2 or 3 full minutes and there have been times where it has been up to 15. There are only 3 people in my department, so we're all in the same office. As such her phone calls get very, very distracting. Hearing it pulls me right out of whatever I'm doing, especially when it's mundane bullshit about dinner plans. Conversely, I VERY rarely take calls at the office and the few times I have to, I leave the room. It seems disrespectful and unprofessional to me to subject people to my personal life. I've mentioned it to my mother previously, but she referred me to my grandfather. He just kind of shook the issue off.\n\nToday after one of my manager's calls I asked her nicely if she might be able to take personal calls to the boardroom when she gets them- its literally right in the next office over. I explained that I find it difficult to concentrate with chatter. Regardless of the policy we have I don't care what she does or how often she takes calls- I just have a lot of work to do and it makes it harder to focus hearing her go on and on. She said \"What, so all I'm allowed to do in here is work? Is that what you're telling me?\" and got really defensive about it. I tried explaining that it's just too distracting, but she got passive-aggressive about it and we didn't get anywhere. When I said good night before leaving, she didn't say a word to me. I told my mom and grandfather what happened and they just shook their heads and chuckled at me, so they weren't opposed to what I did- they just don't want to be involved.\n\nI try to be personable as much as possible, but at the end of the day I'm not there to make friends or coddle people's feelings. I am there to work and keep the company strong. That's it.

We're 6 floors tall, one of which is a manufacturing area where we make some of the wares.  There's machinery, chemicals, fumes, and salty workers on that floor who occasionally discuss at a shout which one of the others can go fuck himself and whether or not Tony Romo is a fag.  A bunch of people involved in the manufacturing have to come and go from this floor throughout the day, are usually pretty grimy and they use a stairwell in the back of the store (right by a back entrance).  \n\nBecause we don't want customers to go anywhere near this area, we provide an elevator in the front of the store that goes to every other floor, but not the factory unless you have a key.  The sales staff is dressed formally, and the customers are usually dressed well.  The stairwell is behind an \"employees only\" door and isn't easy to find.  So, you don't even know it exists unless you ask for special treatment.\n\nSomehow, when they find out there is an elevator that takes them to the upper floors, 1 out of 20 shoppers *have* to ask if there's a staircase they can use instead.  We used to assume some people were claustrophobic or feared elevators and led them through the stairway as a courtesy.  Eventually, it became clear that the majority of people asking for the stairs were only doing so because they want \"the exercise\".  So we started explain to whoever asked that there is a stairway that goes through a maintenance area, but it's really not suitable for the public, which is why we provide the elevator.  Virtually all of them say they'd rather take the stairway anyway.

He's a retired British male who frequently works with models from the UK - he says that as long as she pays for the flights he's happy to provide her with accommodation and food for the weekend, in exchange for a photoshoot and her posing for his life drawing class.  \n  \nShe mentioned that she'd feel better if I could come along too, which the photographer said was fine.

She keeps asking me what I think he's going to do, and I guess I can't really provide a clear answer - it's just in my nature not to trust a stranger, especially within an industry like modelling which I argued is notorious for exploitation.

What I want to know is what others have to say about this whole situation. I've never had any real bouts with family so, I'm feeling a bit caught off guard about all of this, if nothing else.\n\nSo here's what happened:\n\nMy Grandpa passed away recently (early April), relatively unexpectedly and tragically. I booked an emergency flight home from abroad as soon as I had news about funeral arrangements. I was home for about a week, just enough time to get settled in at home, be there for the funeral and spend sometime with family. Even though I had just been back in the States two weeks prior for a planned visit, original plans were suddenly changed with the deterioration in my grandpas health, landing him in the hospital twice in the last week and a half.\n\nLet me back up in potential build-up of drama by stating the following:\n\nOnce the news of his death came to me, having waited overnight, not to mention giving myself a chance to calm down as the news was hard to take as I was very close to my Grandpa, and he was my last grandparent, I changed my Facebook profile to the original picture of a 1952 portrait of my grandparents I have tattooed on my shoulder blade. I also changed my profile banner to a picture of my Grandpa with two of my favorite cousins and I during the last time I was in Georgia with my family (2008, the spring after my Grandma, his wife, has passed from Alzheimer's). Going to GA for Easter used to be a family tradition up until I'd say the last 12 years ago or so. Since then, it has become much more sporadic because of my Grandparents health slowly deteriorating as they aged (and public schools spring break not lining up with Easter any more).\n\nAnyway, moving on: shortly after changing my pictures, my aunt Tami (married to my Mom's brother), sent me a message that said \"OP:... My son doesn't know yet.\" To which I asked if she wanted me to change them. She said yes. I didn't.\n\nInstead, I replied that I didn't see what the problem was. I didn't post a status / any words about what had happened. I simply changed my pictures. I also noted that I wasn't even friends with her son on FB. She retaliated that there was still GA family that didn't know about what had happened and that FB wasn't the place for them to find out. I agreed, but reaffirmed that I only changed my pictures specifically for that reason. *No further correspondence.*\n\nThe weekend after the funeral, the family began work on Grandpas house to get it ready to put up for sale on the open market. As we began to start clearing it out for renovations, the majority of the family was there making piles of trash, donation, and keep. Having recently moved 4,000+ miles away to Germany, I opted not to keep much of anything save for a few sentimental items:\n* Good Housekeeping cookbook 1969 (containing a few recipies I knew him and Grandma used)\n* Family Genealogy book\n* Military uniform, ribbons and medals\n* Letters from Grandpa to Grandma while in the AF stationed in Germany circa August - February 1952 (my other cousin, Britt, kept the remainder of the stack of letters from 1953 and 1969).\nI wanted to keep his military photo album too, but Mom said not yet. Of the few things I kept, I went through the house checking with every member of my family that they did not want the items I wanted. I always asked my uncle Mike first, as he was the eldest remaining child. No one had any objections.\n\nA few days after the clean up, I left to come back to my new home across the pond. Not a week after being back, my Mom was messaging me telling me not to be surprised if Tami sends me a message asking for Grandpas military medals. Confused, she explained that Tami and her daughter Sarah, wanted to make a special memorial display of the flag presented to Mike at the funeral and include Grandpa's original military medals and ribbons in his honor as a gift to Mike for Father's Day.\n\nUpon request (and without my knowledge), my Mom told Tami that she had the medals, but that they meant a lot to me and she would check with me before letting her have them. She also suggested to get duplicate medals and ribbons from and army surplus store. Unfortunately, this solution is not favorable by the requesting party. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I did not receive any correspondence from Tami.\n\nFast-forward to just the other day:\nMy cousin Sarah (Mike and Tami's daughter), sent me a message again requesting Grandpas military medals and ribbons. She noted that her dad \"didn't ask for much when we were cleaning the house since he was just trying to hold it together.\" I responded cordially stating that I think the display is a wonderful and thoughtful gift idea for her father, but that I feel it is important the original medals and ribbons stay with his original uniform. I reinforced the purchase of duplicate medals and ribbons for Mike's display, as I wanted to make a shadow box display of my own showcasing Grandpas military memorabilia, and that it would look weird with new medals and an old uniform. Furthermore, I suggested incorporating his service certificates (which Mike actually *DID* want) into the display. Sarah said in her response message to me that she was, \"not trying to take Grandpas things from [me but is] trying to do something for [her] dad who's having a hard time.\" I replied to her, that I only took a total of 4 items the day of the initial clean and that while she isn't \"trying\" to take something from me, she *would* be taking a huge part of the 1 out of 4 things I have to remember our Grandpa by. I concluded the message by saying \"I hope you understand.\"\n\nHer only response: \"I don't at all.\"\n\nA few minutes later, she posts a status that says \"Wow how my eyes have been opened over the last month and a half!\" I \"liked\" it out of irony. She immediately sends me a message that says, \"Do me a favor and don't like my status. Delete me if you want. I just don't care anymore.\" One of her friends commented with concern about what the status was about. She replied simply stating \"People who only think about themselves.\" Clearly, the status is about me (should I make a point here that I am considerably younger than her?).\n\nI didn't condone her messages with a response but rather, a lack of action or response. \n\nWell Reddit, that's what happened. No words since. I'm not sure how to feel about this. Mostly I want to say \"fuck it,\" but I can't seem to let it go because 1) This is surprising to me and 2) Grandpa wouldn't want this and it makes me sad.\n\nStill though, I keep having to fight the urge to say something to her \n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE HERE?!", "score": 24, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "36p81c", "name": "t3_36p81c", "created_utc": 1432170169.0, "title": "AITA for ignoring someone who texted while driving?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "So I got into a new guild in a game.

She made it clear a number of times she wanted him to leave me and be with her, including sending him a tape of her masterbating. It was really hurtful he continued to.be her friend for so long. Nothing physical happened between the two of them, but they did hang out. On one occasion he even forgot that we were meeting for lunch because I needed help carrying a lunch tray as I was walking with crutches due to a knee injury. He went to lunch with her because she was having a bad day while I waited around like an idiot. He didn't even call me, so I found this out that night when he got back from class. He said he felt bad for her because she found out she had MS and her boyfriend was a serial cheater, etc. I never told him he had to cut her out of his life because I don't think it is right to dictate who he spent his time with, even though it really hurt me. He even considered having us \"take a break\" when she told him she and her boyfriend were taking a break. I told him I loved him, but if he wanted to take a break to see where things could go with another woman than I considered it a break up. I told him I wanted him to be happy, but I would not sit around and be a doormat and wait for him while he slept with someone else.I would accept decision, but if he didn't chose me we were done. He chose me and eventually phased her out of his life.\n\n\nI have forgiven him. We met young and he didn't expect to meet someone he would be so serious with when he did. I do.understand that, but he still treated me pretty horribly and while I have tried to let it go completely, the hurt doe creep up from time to time because it was such a tough time for me and really hits a sensitive, insecure part of me.\n\nWe have a great life a d a great married. We even survived the loss of our oldest daughter six days after birth to trisomy 18. We have two other daughters (2.5 years old and 10 months old). I had to get a hysterectomy because of pain and issues. This has been hard on me. Now I am making ovarian cysts on the one ovary I have left. The pain, disappointment and fear is causing me a lot stress (and physical pain). I may need to have this ovary removed, which will put me into full menopause and I am only 29. I can't do hormone replacement and this could shorten my life by 20 years. As we are waiting to get my prescription for pain medication and finding out I have to call my gynocologist to figure this all out, my husband goes, \"oh, hey, it was L's birthday and she mentioned she is pregnant with a little boy.\" I know she has a daughter to. I just said that was nice and I hope it means her MS is under control. I meant it to because I don't wish her ill. MS is a terrible thing for anyone to go through and she was young, scared and looking for a better man. What she did was wrong, but desperate people do desperate things. I can let that go.\n\nNow to the heart of it all. It. Bothered me that he is Facebook friends with her and knows what is going on in her life. It bothers me that he mentioned her because it feels like he brought her into our lives, even though it was something small. I was feeling nervous and in pain and he had to bring her up. It was frustrating, but I know it wasn't something done to be cruel. He just saw it and mentioned it like he does with so many other things.\n\nI took the opportunity to try to talk with him about it last night. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but when it was fresh we couldn't talk about it without tears and so much pain. I was curious about a few things and asked if he would be comfortable talking about it with me. He adMota what he did in college was wrong. He hates he caused me so much pain and was ashamed he did that to me, but it was the past and he was over it. Now, I don't want him to feel bad and ashamed forever, but he basically told me it doesn't ever bother him anymore because he is a different man and that I helped make him that better man. I get that and appreciate that he feels that way, but it bother me a bit that he doesn't feel ashamed about it at all now. It still was him who caused me that pain. I also wanted to know what it was about her than made her worth hurting me, what made him chose her over me so many times. He claimed that's not what he was doing. I explained that by going out and spending time with her knowing it hurt me, he decided to put her above me, that he valued spending time with her more and I wanted to understand what made him feel she was more worth it than I was. He swears up and down it isn't like that. That he doesn't quantify relationships like that. I tried to explain that when he choses to do something he knew would hurt me in order to do something for someone else thst he wasn't putting me first. He chose to make the other person more important. He kept insisting things don't work that way. It felt like her wasn't trying to see things my way and understand why it hurt as much as it did and how that insecurity is still with me today. He just kept insisting thst it wasn't like that. I told him it felt like he was bringing her into our lives by mentioning her. I explained that I needed his love and support because of what is physically going in with me and mentioning someone who caused me so much pain really hurt me. He asked if I wanted him to unfriend her. I told him that I would never tell him who to associate with and that was his choice (and I mean that). It's not like I think he is going to have an affair with her or that he is having long conversations with her. That said, it does hurt that he still has allowed her to be in his life, even in this incredibly minor way, because of the past history. I tried explaining that it hurt because she was a reminder of the troughest point in our relationship. He went on a rant how he never sees or talks to anyone from college. His best friend from college, who was like a brother to him, died 8 years ago from lymphoma  (we were there for him the whole time). I know it hurts him he doesn't spend time with anyone else from school. We have talked about it in the past. That said, this is a person who tried to convince him to leave me for her. She actively perused him and while he didn't have a physical relationship she, what he done could be seen as an emotional affair. I feel like not having any form of contact wit h her is a given. Apparently not. Hell, if he insists on being her friends for whatever resson, don't talk about her to me, especially when I am suffering depression and anxiety and physical pain. I mean, if something bad happened to her and she needed help I would be more okay with that because she doesn't have a lot of support. But why tell me about her life? If I had someone like that in my past (I don't, because no matter how many people tried to peruse me in high school and college, and there were a few who tried, I never did anything like that to him) I would not have any contact with them at all. Hell, I avoided the guy who asked me to a school dance (in college) because he knew I had a boyfriend and was still clearly trying to make a move on me out of respect for our relationship. I don't want to tell him he can't talk to her at all. I do trust him. It just hurts thst he doesn't even understand why this hurts me. We usually communicate very well, but it feels like he refuses to fully listen and see why this hurts me. I finally got so frustrated I told him just to forget about it. He asked this morning if I am still upset over it and I told him that I am. I am working on letting it go, but it all really hurts me, especially that he can't understand why it hurts me so much.\n\n\nSorry if this is long and confusing.

One of my best friends has had a rough couple of years. He doesn't really deal with emotions well, and has had a couple of deaths in his family, had a girlfriend who he didn't feel treated him right which after the breakup practically drove him to alcoholism, and most notably 1,5 years ago found out his brother (who had 2 kids) had been beaten to the point where he's pretty much dead, and since the people who did it never got caught, and his brother still breathes he hasn't had any closure.\n\nLast summer, he met a bipolar girl, and in a few weeks they got together. She lived in a town about 80 miles from here, and they met during the weekends. After a few months when he lost his job he moved to her.\n\nTo sum up their relationship, he complained that she constantly made things to make him feel bad, and he said she was always bossy and stuff. She later revealed that she only did that to make him feel something, since he was living in a bubble after what happened to his brother, and all of a sudden he started feeling lots of things. Eventually, he started seeing a psychologist which made him feel better, and learn lots of things about himself.\n\nAfter maybe 3 months of living together, she broke up with him because she couldn't stand how negative he was. He turned to alcohol and wanted to kill himself, and she got in touch with him and they worked things out and he started only seeing things positively. No negative things at all in his life, only optimism, and that can be good.\n\nNow to the point. She broke up with him, since apparently they were fighting constantly and she couldn't take it. The following week he was actually writing to me and our buddy about wanting to kill himself, and that he drank every night to be able to sleep. We told him to stop it and move away from her ASAP, since he complained she was doing everything she could to make him feel like crap. He first said she blamed him for making her act like that since *he* was really immature, and we really told him that he should GTFO. He said he wanted to try again, but she said there was no chance they would do that. Important here is that while being sad he was complaining about her always blaming everything on him, and always bossing him around and making him feel worthless.\n\nThe same weekend they both got drunk and ended up in bed, and talked everything out and he understood that despite he really wanted to try again with a relationship it just wouldn't happen. We said that was great and really pushed him to look for an apartment.\n\nA few days later he pretty much wrote *\"Well the pile of shit that is my life won't get smaller. Guess who's pregnant.\"*, and me and my buddy's thought was of course that he didn't really want a kid. We asked him how he felt about it and what they were planning on doing (keeping the kid or not), and he said he didn't know, but it didn't matter since it was her decision. Remember that this is in Sweden where abortion is probably more accepted among the people.\n\nThis is where stuff got bad. We told him that she shouldn't be the one to decide over his life, and if he didn't want to be a dad he shouldn't have to, and if he didn't want the kid the decision would be up to her, and if she wanted to keep the kid all by herself, knowing the dad wouldn't be there, the kid would be her problem. We said this thinking that she was actually considering an abortion, because we felt she was running him over and wanted him to stand up and say it would be stupid to have a kid if that was what he thought. We of course pointed out that they weren't in a good position to get a kid since they broke up and were never going to get together again, and because she wasn't mentally healthy and he had just started to take some babysteps into becoming mentally stable it would be hard, since getting a kid can be a huge pressure and can make people depressed, and she couldn't even handle him for a week acting immature without driving him to the edge of suicide.\n\nA few days later he wrote that he had thought about it and couldn't see a single thing bad about getting a kid. Only positive things. We of course asumed she had decided they were keeping the kid, and he was just trying to make the best of it. We told him to be realistic, and that getting a kid would turn his life upside down and that he shouldn't just do it because this wasn't just a puppy he could give away, or an ugly tattoo he could laser away, but something permanent which could be a financially and mentally monumental challenge. We told him to think seriously about it and encouraged him that if he didn't want the kid, he should tell her that, and we told him to think critically about the whole situation and not just think \"it'll all work out\", since that's his usual mindset which doesn't really always work out.\n\nA few days later, he tells us we have for the final time stepped over the line and that we were horrible people who told him to rule over his girl and that if we really would do something like that to our own girlfriends we deserve to be castrated, and many more things. She wrote directly to me that she wished my mother would abort me. They said we blamed her for everything and thought it was her fault and that he should just leave her to deal with the problem on her own, and they were both furious that we even mentioned an abortion. She was adopted as a kid, and I can see her being upset about that since we'd basically suggest her parents should've aborted her since she apparently was an unwanted child.\n\nHe basically said that if we would ever see his child or him again we'd have to apologize for everything. I said we didn't know she was so against abortions, but he was furious about us even mentioning it and just said all his other friends reacted positively when he said \"I'm going to be a dad\", which in my opinion is a completely different statement for them to react to. My buddy had earlier pretty much told him that if they'd be stupid if they kept the kid, but that was mostly a desperate attempt to get him out of his fantasy-bubble about everything just working itself out, but I can see him being pissed about that.\n\nI wrote endless walls of text breaking down every single word we said and explained how we thought, and I apologized for misunderstanding the situation and drawing the false conclusion that she was considering abortion when she apparently was not, but that their reaction was based on a completely different context than the one we knew about, and that based on the context we knew about we didn't really say anything wrong. We might've used some harsh words and went for some hard \"brotherly love\", but we never meant any harm. He wouldn't buy that, and kept saying that it was all our fault because we drew conclusions, and  that it didn't matter what he had told us earlier since he was sad at that moment, but I maintained that it didn't matter if he was sad because we went by the information we had and tried to support him.\n\nI said I won't apologize if I don't think I've done something wrong, and until he tells me exactly what I've done wrong and I can't explain it with something else than that I was actually wrong, I won't apologize. He wouldn't accept that or even keep talking, but just ended the contact right there. It took more than a week of constant talking before we reached that point, and I was pretty shook up and genuinely angry with his way of dealing with it.\n\nHe later wrote to me in private (we had all conversation in a group chat on Facebook between me, him and our buddy) that he was most sad about losing me as a friend, and that he thought I had gotten less rational and humble than I was earlier. I replied back with a long breakdown of everything that happened, pretty much like I've done here, and he later replied that he didn't really want to do this at all, but just did it because he and the girl had agreed to try to get together again in a few months and since she hated us for what we said he had to get rid of us to get back with her. He said he'd try to work it out with all of us later, but he'd have to get back with her first. \n\nSo, are we the assholes for asuming they were considering an abortion and maybe (probably) being biased to that outcome, or should we have just nodded and agreed to everything he said? Should we have given any advice at all or just played along? \n\nTL;DR: Friend in mentally bad place gets dumped by bipolar girlfriend *twice*, gets her pregnant after other breakup, he says he has nothing to say about keeping the kid or not, we say he should have the right to decide just like she does and that they're in a bad place to get a kid right now, she ends up wanting me dead for suggesting an abortion and he cancels our friendship.", "score": 9, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38a7dt", "name": "t3_38a7dt", "created_utc": 1433282500.0, "title": "Am I the asshole for replying multiple times to a guy who just keeps editing his comment to make me look worse?", "link_flair_text": "everyone sucks", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38ap73", "name": "t3_38ap73", "created_utc": 1433289901.0, "title": "AITA for cutting off the girl who lied about sleeping with someone.", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "I met a girl and we started to get serious fairly quickly.

That that would be a problem, however I would like to know before hand so that we could either deal with it appropriately or choose to not proceed.  She promised and swore and down that she hadn't.  To the point that on multiple occasions she made me feel like an asshole for ever asking.  Well fast forward three years, and it turns out she has...and with the same someone she said she hadn't.  I told her that she knowingly decieved me and lied and covered it up and that we would no longer be together.  She claims it was a drunken mistake and that she lied because she wanted to be with me and she knew telling me early on.  Would make that impossible.  Since than she has been very loyal.  This lie however is significant and makes me wonder if her excuse about being drunk and it being one time is even true.  As well as calls into question if other things she has said are lies as well.  Am I the asshole for telling her this is irreparable?\n\nEdit 1:  First off thank you for everyone for your replies.  The two sides of the replies is exactly how I have been going back and forth in my head.  Yes she lied yes that dishonest.  She did it to stay with me.  Yet she knew the consequences of lying.  However has been seemingly loyal while together.  It is scary to think what else she has lied about though.\n\nEdit 2:  For those saying it was unfair for me to ask.  Well it is a very tight knit community this place and I knew people would be talking.  I wanted to to know the character of the person I was going to be with.  And if it was a person who was into one night stands or bounced from person to person.  Well than it wasn't for me.  She made it seem like how she was being with me me was special and not common.  So I did not want to be just another guy who just happened to come along.  If she was just going down the list, well than I wasn't something special.  I was just someone who worked out.  \n\nEdit 3:  For those saying at least she came clean when caught.  Well not really it took someone telling me directly to my face for me  to find out.  Which coincidentally is one of the reasons I wanted to know.  If I am defending her honor when people question it by saying oh she has been with some guys and I am saying oh know never she is not like that.  Well I look like a dumb fuck.  So when i did confront she didn't fess up at first.  As always she tried to make me feel bad for listening to others and questioning her.  Something she often did as a means to cover it up.  \n\nEdit 5:  I will tell everyone what bothers me more than the first lie.  It's the way the second and third unfolded.  First she says oh she was out drinking and this guy who we know just called her and asked if she wanted to join him out for drinks.  So she said she went just as friends.  Now from my understanding if a guy you barley know or just met calls you individually to come hang out at a bar to drink with him and his friends.  As a woman you know there is more to it.  So she goes there and gets absolutely plastered.  Guy asks for a ride home she obliges.  He asks her to come in for more drinks and she says she just went to drink and didn't think it was anything more.  Well come on now...a guy of you don't know that well invites you up late at night as a woman you know what that is.  She than says oh we got really drunk I dont know how my clothes ended off and I kinda remember flashes of things.  First she says she doesn't remember sex.  And I tell her as a woman she would know the next day.  She finally admits.  I question if protection was used she says yes ofcourse.  But than if you can't remember how would you know.  So she makes me feel like an  asshole saying she doesn't remember the night and she is ashamed.  Well this deer in headlights things doesn't play well to me.  It seems like she would know why she is going to meet him and why she is going upstairs.  On further pressing she finally admits she remembers being on the bed making out with clothes on,  but once again ofcourse she doesn't remember how sex happened or how clothes got off,  and that she didn't know they would have sex.  I say lying on a a strange mans  bed and gooling around sexually and you don't think that?  Once again oh I can't remember what else happened.  Well eventually she admits she thought the guy was nice and she didn't know anyone down here and just wanted to be wanted.  So alot of the story doesn't add up together to me.  And to seems me that she is using my love for her to play me for a fool.  The whole oh that wasn't my intention and I don't remember what happened...seems very convenient.  She says it was mistake and  once she realized he only wanted sex she stopped,  I wonder what actually happened and if she indeed stopped and if there were others.

The mutual friend even told me secretly that she (the girl) likes me, so I saw that as a plus, but didn't make a move because I had just broken up with my then-exgf.\n\nTime passes, and by January, we had already reached second base without being in a serious relationship (hugs, kisses, loads of innuendo). Here is when I began considering escalating the relationship to something more serious, but I didn't get through with it.\n\nComes February, and 2 days before Valentine's day (which was the day I intended to escalate it), she comes out angry at me because she thinks I was head over heels for another girl. She forced an answer out of me which didn't make sense even to me. Do note that I once was indeed in love with that other girl, but by the time this happened, my feelings for the other girl were long gone. Then comes Valentine's day, when I propose to escalate the relationship. But when I told her about taking it seriously, she just walked away furiously. That's when shit started to go downhill for me. All of her friends started spamming me because apparently she STILL thought that I was going for both her and that other girl. Luckily, I managed to explain it to the mutual acquaintance, and she helped clear it out between us for a while. It worked.\n\nAfter the storm calmed down, I was still affected by the fact that she was angry at me, even though we still got along as if nothing happened. When we once stayed over at my place, she said that I was seemed more depressed than usual. I told her in a civilized way the reasons, and she suddenly reveals that she was already in a serious relationship with a russian guy she met on Chatroulette since New Year's. I know myself that long distance relationships rarely work out, but either way still genuinely wished the best for her. I myself had broken up already from a LDR, and I knew how it felt having the only person that cares about you thousands of miles away. However, I got angry at the fact that she didn't tell me before that she was in a relationship. A week passes, and everything is back to normality again.\n\nFast forward to April. I met another one of her friends while I was out with my friends. I try to greet her quite some times, but she doesn't seem to pay any attention. I get frustrated a bit, and say under my breath something among the lines of \"oh for fuck's sake can't you at least return a greeting? (followed by something pretty nasty for a girl here, but normal among guys)\". She somehow didn't hear my greetings, but she did hear the last part. She went off and told that I was talking shit about her to our mutual friend, and to the second protagonist of this anecdote. Arguments break out against me, 2 of her friends removed and blocked me, the mutual friend told me to stay away from them and her and blocked me aswell, and the girl I had feelings for drops a very angry voice note, blocking me aswell for a week, then unblocking me.\n\nSince then, I have tried apologizing to the girl personally, but to no avail. Whenever we see eachother face-to-face, she pretends that I don't exist, and from her behaviour, I have developed a similar response; but I still feel horrible whenever I am near her, and just thinking about what happened makes me want to vomit.\n\nSo... was I the genuine asshole, or was I being played around with?", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38cxog", "name": "t3_38cxog", "created_utc": 1433334040.0, "title": "AITA for being irritating to a girl", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "Some background story:\nI've been talking to this girl who works with my sister, not constantly, but from time to time and recently I've gotten a liking to her.

So she writes in the description Hey guys last night was fun but someone stole my bottle of champagne and it was really expensive and I want to know which dickhead it was so they can pay me for being inconsiderate. So I'm like ok I suppose this is reasonable, thinking it was like an \u00a380 (~120USD) bottle or something. So the entire group jumps on the bandwagon - including myself - trying to figure it out, we all looked at pictures of the night and questioned people and stuff. She starts getting really shitty about the whole situation and starts saying really quite nasty things about whoever it was that took the champagne, naturally people are starting to give up and she starts abusing them. So people ask her how much the champagne was and it turned out to be just a \u00a310 bottle from a corner-shop. This girl has a history of being an attention seeker and she's always kind of annoyed me, so yes this was a bit of me getting sick of her, but she really is your stereotypical \u00fcber annoying privileged-private-school-girl. I messaged her saying that the fact that she's started this whole group and lied to people about the price and crucified whoever took the champagne was way out of order and that she should have just let it go. She unsurprisingly says whatever and presumedly said nasty things about me to her friends.\n\nHere comes the plot twist:\n\nIt was me. I was the thief. In my defence I had absolutely no idea it was me. I had zero recollection of the nights events the next morning and nothing had come back to me. There was a single photo of me holding the \u00a310 bottle in question (proof?) and she leapt at the opportunity to blame me. She reopened the group, for the sole purpose of telling the group of people who'd attended that it was me. She posted pictures of the messages I'd sent her about how she'd blown the whole thing out of proportion, and deliberately omitted the messages I'd sent her apologising for what I'd done, and that I genuinely had no idea that I was the culprit. I felt pretty persecuted and got a lot of messages from people telling me I was a dick. I obviously said I would pay for the \u00a310 pound bottle of expensive champagne. I posted on the group explaining myself and she deleted it, and a subsequent screenshot of the post my friend had put up later.\n\nI know that the act of stealing the champagne was wrong, and I'd be happy to just have peace of mind. I understand if I'm the asshole I just want unbiased opinions on the matter.\n\n**EDIT:** I found out I was the culprit at the *very* end of the witch hunt. One of my mates found the picture and posted it half-jokingly, not really expecting anybody to care anymore, seeing as it was \u00a310.\n\n**EDIT 2:** I didn't have the bottle to myself, I was pictured pouring the bottle into like 8 different cups in outstretched hands.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I drank the bottle with anybody who wanted some.

He has been asked to stop twice, but rather than apologize, he tries to justify it by saying he learned those jokes from a gay guy and the guy makes those jokes all the time.  Our drummer wants him gone because he just constantly does stuff to piss him off, i.e. moving stuff on the drumset, changing the tone on the set.

If you asked me to tell you what is going on inside his head when he is spoken to, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0) would be my answer.  Let me count the ways:\n\n* We all don't have a lot of money, just enough for equipment maintenance, gas, and food.  The guitarist, drummer, and I came up with a plan to put together a band fund so that when we need lights, smoke machines, etc. or someone needed to replace a piece of equipment quickly, we don't have to shell out money from our pockets and instead use the money we've saved up.  He refused to throw in, not because it would've put a crimp in his finances, but because he didn't comprehend the point.\n\n* 2 months after bragging about having enough money to replace any piece of equipment we, as a band, owned, he has now had to pick up a 2nd job after falling behind on rent.  In that time, he decided to buy **A GODDAMNED SAILBOAT.**\n\n* One of two vehicle owners in the band, has a truck that could be useful to get to a from peformances, but it needs a windshield replacement, an alignment, new tires, and fluids replaced.  Spends money on a boat and his street bike instead.\n\n* On the day of a performance, he chooses to ride to a town that is an hour away from our rehearsal space an hour before we agreed to meet.  He then gets stuck in traffic, causing him to be 2.5 hours late.  The reason?  He wanted to refill his tank of whippets.\n\nSo tell me...am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of him simply because he's stupid?", "score": 5, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38eesn", "name": "t3_38eesn", "created_utc": 1433353718.0, "title": "AITA for thinking the relationship workload is unbalanced?", "link_flair_text": "everyone sucks", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38efdx", "name": "t3_38efdx", "created_utc": 1433353907.0, "title": "AITA For canceling movie night to go to a party?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "38egxh", "name": "t3_38egxh", "created_utc": 1433354429.0, "title": "AITA for cutting things off", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "So I've had the feels for my best lady friend for like 5 years, I told her like 2 months ago? Basically I couldn't deal with my feelings anymore and just sat her down and told her.\n\nAnother big thing is, I've been going to the church (her father is the pastor) most of my life.. like 10+ years. I've stopped going to that church and attending another church. It isn't solely because of her, but she is part of it. Basically when I go to that church, my focus should be God, my mind should be on God, but it's not. Also to put another loop in it, it is a korean church. Sermons are in Korean, everything mostly is in Korean. I am half Korean, I understand it, read it, and write it at maybe a middle school level. I know enough to survive in Korea, but when it comes to sermons and spiritual growth, the Korean is a whole new level. And a whole other plate of relationship type issues with other ladies hahaha. So there are many reasons, the most important being... my spiritual growth, the next would be my relationship with my lady friend.\n\n3 weeks ago I announced to \"leaders\" of small group, which she is one. That I am no longer coming to church, because I will be going to an American Church.\n\nShe, of course was shocked and wanted to know why and wanted to meet up. I laid it out to her, my feelings, my focus, my spirituality. Let's just say after the talk, I did make her tear up, I've never felt so firm and douchey haha.

Sometimes I felt like she was taking advantage, I was being used, and maybe I had a chance with her(partially why I kept my feelings for her)... but then again I don't know. We've been really good friends for a long time, and I felt like me staying at the church and seeing her would just make things worse. \n\nOh I must say, she's recently obtained a bf. In which, she has brought to church events. Thank the Lord, I wasn't there when she did.

He was 19, I was 21.  He came from a family with very detached parents, I came from a loving, close-knit family.  We were very much the products of our upbringing.  We stayed together until she was ten months old.  During that ten months he was rarely around.  He would stay out until he knew I had her put to bed for the night.  He couldn't stand the sound of her crying, he would never allow himself to be left alone with her.  Looking back as an adult, it is very clear he was young, inexperienced and terrified.  At the time, I was also young and inexperienced, and didn't understand why he couldn't just love and spend time with our daughter.\n\nHe left when she was ten months old, letting me know that I could contact him for child support but he wasn't interested in raising this child.  Once he moved out, I didn't let him move back in, but when he came around feeling sorry for his actions, I wanted him to see our daughter so I allowed visits.\n\nAfter the first couple of visits, he started coming later and later and eventually began showing up after she was in bed.  When I realized he was visiting ME instead of HER, I put a stop to it.  He became angry and again told me that he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.\n\nThis time, I decided there were no take-backs.  From my point of view, I didn't want my daughter to deal with a father that was in-and-out of her life. By this time, she was only a year old, but eventually she would grow up and I never wanted her to hear her own father say outloud that he wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nWe went through the court for our divorce that year.  Having never actually been left alone with our daughter, he was given supervised visitation once/week through a facility in our county.  He attended the first few times and then just stopped showing up.  He didn't even show up to the last two divorce/custody hearings and they ended up finalizing it without him present.  \n\nNow my daughter is 5 and 1/2.  I've always been honest with her about the situation to an age-appropriate level.  (You used to have another daddy, but he knew he wasn't very good at being a daddy so he went away so that your life could be filled with love and joy.  Then it was just you and me for a while until we met _[my husband]__ and now he takes good care of you.)  She loves her step-dad, knows he isn't her biological father but she wants to call him Dad anyway.  She is happy and healthy and thriving.\n\nMy ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her.  I didn't even text him back.  As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don't want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her.  My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I'll let HER choose when they meet up.  I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is  mature enough.  \n\nWe come from a small town, he still talks to friends of friends of friends of mine.  Word has come back to me that people now thing I am this horrible bitch, witholding this poor man from seeing his daughter even when he is repenting for his actions.  \n\nI honestly don't even see him as \"the asshole\" except for the spreading of his pity party.  I see him as a troubled teen who got scared and couldn't handle the task of raising a child.  Up until now, I had actually been thankful to him that he made the choice to leave instead of making her early years harder.  \n\nSorry for the long post, but I feel it was all relevant to understand both sides.

I think the issue is that if I am naked in a bed, it's because something sexual is happening. I sleep in a t-shirt and shorts, *always*, unless sex is happening. Nudity in bed is therefore inherently sexual. From the perspective of somebody who sleeps in clothes, you were doing something sexual in the bed next to her all night, without her permission, and in fact you intended to not even tell her. That is how I would feel in this situation, at least.\n\nOf course, she could have had other reasons for being uncomfortable about it than the issue I'd have had with it, but at the end of the day, you didn't ask, and that makes you the asshole. The argument is still continuing after all these years largely because you still haven't realized that something you don't care about at all (like nudity in bed) can actually be something that really puts other people off. She was made uncomfortable, and instead of just apologizing you try to argue that she shouldn't have been uncomfortable because you wouldn't have been uncomfortable. That's just not how it works.\n\n**tl;dr** you were the asshole and still are the asshole", "link_id": "t3_38fco2", "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38fco2/aita_for_sleeping_naked_next_to_a_friend/cruowat/", "score": 5, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"id": "crum4bb", "body": "I think you know the answer to this.

Out of the two of them, I would say I'm closer to J, but we've lived together at uni since September. We're all part of a larger group of friends and we have a Facebook group chat that we use to just all talk. C and J seem to have a love/hate friendship and often get into arguments of sorts, but always seem to make up in the end.\n\nA few hours ago, we were all just having a conversation on there which I was only loosely following and not really participating in. C then joins in and informs us that she's drunk. We then realise J isn't in the chat for some reason (we later find out someone jokingly kicked him a few weeks before and he never got reinvited), and C then begins to badmouth the band J is in, in this chat **which J is supposed to be in**. Also, J and his girlfriend recently broke up, so she also commented how he's just been feeling sorry for himself lately and it's annoying her.\n\nDuring all this, another friend (D) tells C to delete the messages because he's going to invite J back into the chat. She does so, but doesn't realise it only deletes it for you looking at it. D invites J back in, he says, says \"Fuck off C\" and leaves. I come in at this point saying \"you know he could see those right?\" and she's like \"that's why I deleted them\" and I said \"it only deletes for you...\". No-one else said anything then so I was just like \"meh whatever\".\n\nA few minutes later, J asks me if I can reinvite him. I, knowing what he's like, ask him why and he says \"to see what C put\". This then puts me in an awkward position: if I don't invite J, he'll be mad at me. If I do, C will be mad at me. I tell him \"I'll only invite you if you don't start an argument in the chat\", and invite him back. Lo and behold, he starts arguing. I tell him in the group chat to drop it and talk to Cat privately. Again, it all goes silent and I'm like \"thank god that's over\".\n\nNOPE. Another few minutes later, C messages me saying \"thanks for that\". I quite bluntly tell her he asked me to reinvite him, and not to say stuff online if she doesn't want to risk people seeing it. She then tells me to \"stop being so righteous and up myself as it pisses people off\", implying this isn't something only she feels, and it's not sudden.\n\nWas then just talking to my closest friend in the group (K) about it all and she says C made a chat with her and D when I reinvited J and basically bitched about me in it, calling me an \"arselicker\" (idk if that's used in America, but \"brown-nosing\" is an equivalent term I think?). She then proceeds to change the group chat title to an obvious dig at me for \"people who obviously never bitch about others ever and are so fabulous\" and kick me and J from it.\n\nI tend to not get involved in their arguments, and whenever I do, I try not to pick sides and be as impartial as I can. Basically, should I have invited J back to the chat? He'd obviously already seen what C had said, but I wasn't sure if he still could after being kicked. Either way, one of them was going to be mad at me, and like I said, I'm closer to J.\n\n**TL;DR C badmouthed J in our group chat. J came back, saw and left. J asked me to reinvite, I did on the condition he doesn't make an argument in chat but he does. C hates me for inviting him.

It's to the point where in the entirety of 2014, I was alone in the apartment for 45 minutes total.\n\nI don't like being bothered when I'm cooking - I just want to keep my head down and get on with it, and because of this I rarely use the kitchen.  Someone always comes out and wants to talk to me, or use the stove at the same time, and I don't like being distracted.

Because they were never frozen, total cook time once the water is boiling is around five minutes.  These are the kind of stealth meals I try to make.  \n\nThe girlfriend (who is also a rent paying tenant in this apartment - four people in a five bedroom, in a tight rental market, in a decent location) had asked me to bring these raviolis home and make them because she had come from the dentist and wanted to eat something soft for dinner.\n\nI get home, and the roommate had every surface area in the kitchen covered in food prep work.  Cutting boards, vegetables, packaging, measuring cups, pots and pans, etc.  He had all four stove burners going.\n\nKeep in mind, he is home all day.  He has hours and hours of alone time every single day of the week.  \n\nNormally when this happens - and it happens a lot - I'll just get delivery even if I was planning on cooking that night.  Often, even if I had just come from the grocery store with dinner.  But the girlfriend had her heart set on these raviolis.  So I basically told her \"I can't deal with being down here, I will literally go anywhere with you right now, I will bring home food from a restaurant down the street, I will pay for delivery, I will go to the grocery store and get you whatever you want, there's just no room for me to make these raviolis for you.\"  But she insisted on making them herself, so I removed myself from the situation.  I guess she got him to give up one of the burners and had to dance around him while she heated them up and and then used the same pot for the sauce I had also brought home.\n\nThe thing is, I said all this *right in front of him*.  He can surely tell that I get annoyed at him for doing stuff like this, but I've never \"had a conversation\" with him about it because who am I to tell him when he can or can't use a common area?  I don't feel like I have the right to do that.  Even if I requested it, I don't think he'd care.  I've asked once or twice to use a common room to watch a football game and he sat in the same room the whole time watching a movie on his laptop, no headphones.  He's not a bad guy, it's just that unless it's someone's closed bedroom, he just doesn't give a fuck about boundaries and I've given up.\n\nI don't think my outburst phased him too much - it's two hours later and he's still cooking.  \n\nBut I do feel bad for my passive aggressive behavior.

For this story, let's call the guy I met Logan, and the mutual friend Kevin to make this less confusing.  Also, we're all 16 years old.  Yeah, this is going to be really petty.\n\nI've seen him before in the hallways at school, but we never talked until Kevin made a group chat with our phone numbers (he made it because Logan needed advice and wanted me to talk to him).  We talked and we got on really well, met in person at a party, and now we text just the two of us.  Logan and I started to develop feelings for each other and we texted each other often in a flirty manner.  He often told me things like \"you're beautiful. you're a cutie. you're perfect to me.\"  Once he told me that I was his \"favorite human, favorite girl, favorite reliable friend, favorite humorous friend\" and etc that honestly, it made me really touched.  Then we hung out once, and we had a lot of fun.  He even admitted to me a little before we hung out that he liked me.  I told him that I liked him too.  But for some reason, he never asked me to be his girlfriend despite having many good chances to.\n\nThings started to go downhill a while after that.  One day, Kevin texted me asking me if I really liked Logan.  I said \"that's a funny question to ask.\"  and then Kevin told me that Logan just wanted to be good friends.  That made me devastated.. I kind of started to get upset at him, and before I started freaking out and saying something I regret I asked him to stop texting me.  Then I texted Logan and asked if he really asked Kevin to tell me that.  He said yes.. and explained it was because \"you're amazing and all, but I've had my heart broken a lot from liking people and from past relationships and I'm not ready to date ANYONE. but when I'm ready I'll tell you. right now I just want to be close friends.\"  (To be honest, I think he's only had one girlfriend though?  Makes me wonder why he'd feel this way, but who am I to question him when I don't know his entire history..?) He expressed a lot of concern when I was upset, saying that he felt terrible and couldn't eat.  So I made sure that I looked happy and told him that I was okay the next day, despite still feeling like absolute shit.  \n\nHe didn't really treat me the same after that.  He no longer was flirty and no longer complimented me a lot like he used to.  I can live with that, but admittedly I really liked the attention since boys have never treated me like that before...  And he started to text me less and less.  Before, he'd text me right when he woke up, right after school, and until we went to bed.  Now he takes forever to text me, he'd usually text me at 7:00 at night.  Logan once asked \"why don't you text me :(\" though..  I told him that I was afraid I'd be annoying him and that he might be actually busy, but I would start to text him first.  I tried that once, it went okay, then the next time he'd take forever to reply, saying excuses like \"sorry I was at work. sorry I thought I sent you that message.\" which I'm not sure if I can 100% believe.  Now he doesn't text me unless he needs something from me like when does school start tomorrow and all that..\n\nYesterday he texted me \"Hey, are you mad at me or something.\"  I told him \"Umm, what?  Why?\"  Logan then told me someone told him that I was.  Which was strange because I never said ANYTHING about being mad at him to anyone.  I told him that, and I admitted that I do talk about him sometimes to my trusted friends.  Logan asked what I talk about.  And well....\n\nWhen I talk about him, I mostly talked about how our relationship is going,  asked for advice, how attractive, adorable, and amazing he is, yknow.  And I REALLY did not want to admit that.  Logan kept bugging me to tell him(mostly over text), and I kept telling him no in a joke-y manner.  He kind of acted like that until he finally said \"Fine, be that way.\"  I realized that he was serious, and I texted him a sincere apology saying sorry that I'm being a jerk to you (was I?) , that my friend and I like to talk about boys and I just talk about him in general and what he's said to me (I just said basically that, nothing about advice as I've stated before. ) and that I didn't want to admit anything because maybe he'd be weirded out.  He hasn't replied since then.\n\nNow, am I being the asshole or is it him? I've felt like that he's been leading me on because he was saying all those things about liking me and then telling me that a relationship wasn't going to happen.  But I try to understand that he's probably afraid to get his heart broken again and all.  But if he didn't want a relationship though, why did he treat me all special and then break MY heart?  Plus he didn't really understand why that made me feel upset.. he was asking why I was upset and then just said again \"I never said I wouldn't date you.. I just wouldn't date ANYBODY.\"  And now he won't text me, I'm assuming he is mad that I wouldn't admit what I say about him.  I haven't texted him myself, the last thing I sent was the apology and I haven't seen him in school.   But I apologized and I finally told him some part of it so he can stop bugging me.. Why is he still mad?  It's kind of petty imo.  Was that really that bad?\n\nHe is often known as a very nice kid. If you'd ask someone what he was like they'd most likely say \"he is the sweetest and most adorable guy ever.  he would bend over backwards to help you, etc.\"  When I tell my mom about how our relationship is kind of not going well she says \"he's such a nice kid I don't think he's avoiding you because he's mad at you.\"  Which makes me doubt myself.. Is it really all my fault? Did I do something wrong without realizing it?  Did I do something when we hung out? Did he change his mind about me and thinks that I'm weird and annoying? I really don't get it.\n\nI'm sorry if this is confusing because it's not written very well.  I'm a terrible writer, so if you need me to elaborate on something I'd be happy to.\n\n", "score": 3, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38gilo", "name": "t3_38gilo", "created_utc": 1433381669.0, "title": "AITA for posting a Snapchat story to deliberately piss off the girl I like?", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "Here's the backstory:\n\nFor about 6 months I've liked this girl who I have known for about 6 years.

Fine, not the result I had hoped for, but let's just move on from it. I called my friends up to express my anger about the situation, and how I felt that upset that it seemed as though she wasn't going to let me know that she didn't want to go out that night.\n\nHere is where the drama begins. 2 hours later she posts an story on Snapchat that said she was on her way to a town nearby where we live.

She hasn't told me this and doesn't know that I know that she is pissed at me.

I understand I should've said thank you in that situation, but was her rudeness necessary in this case? \nThis dumb and meaningless interaction has been hanging over my head for a year.", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "38gxnr", "name": "t3_38gxnr", "created_utc": 1433388194.0, "title": "I beat up an Autistic schoolmate", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "I made a throwaway for this because enough people I know on reddit could identify me because of this story. This is sort of long compared to other posts, but I do believe that a lot of background information is necessary for proper judgement. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible, but I apologize in advance.\n\n**~~A Little~~ Background on Me, The Autistic schoolmate, and my school:**  \nI'm jewish. Not particularly religious, but I don't take antisemitism very kindly. Normally I can brush certain things off, as long as they're very clearly in fun, even when they're not so friendly I can laugh it off myself. Physically I'm big enough to come off as intimidating, I'm built very heavily from weightlifting but I'm also very lean. A bear-jew, if you will.\n\nAs for the person that I beat up, this is what I know about him: He surely has some experience with being bullied. He doesn't come off as normal in appearance or behavior and he clearly has a disorder on the Autism Spectrum. Physically he's long and skinny, with almost albino white skin and very bright blond hair, and a scruffy blond neckbeard. Disregarding all of that, this kid is absolutely brilliant when it comes to Math and Science. For the rest of the post, let's call him Mike.\n\nMy particular highschool is a small, publicly funded so not private, \"specialized\" school for people with interest in STEM fields. 150 kids at most and every single one of them is a huge nerd, including me. Among other things my school comes off as a safe-haven for kids who have had experience as a victim of bullying, and as a matter of fact my \"fight\" with Mike was the first physical \"fight\" at the school in at least 4 years.\n\n\n**Prelude to Story for extra background:**  \nThe fight happened when we were both Juniors, so we had known each other for the better half of 3 years. He's said things that have gotten on everybody's nerves, many of these things were along the lines of bragging about his intelligence. Nobody would say he came off as nice, and everybody after so long had come to the conclusion that he had some severe mental disorder. \n\nHe tended to say things to specifically get on people's nerves, as well. Not just once, he would repeat them very often.\n\nThe past few years, between high school and the internet, have included the most antisemitism that I've ever been exposed to. It might be a new trend and it might just be growing up to realize it was there all along, whatever. I became the target of jew-jokes, and for quite a while I handled it very well. When Mike hopped on board with the trend (or whatever) he didn't quite seem to get the patterns in what actually made jew-jokes funny. He would mostly go into the holocaust, and say jokes about Jew's being gassed and burned, while the norm seemed to mostly be about Jews being greedy, of course with the occasional Holocaust reference which was deemed funny for its shock value.\n\n**Now for what I may be an asshole for:**  \n*I'll refer to myself as Moishe when needed*  \nOne day, a Wednesday, I was going off task while in a group project with him and another student who-- this doesn't actually matter too much-- was half-black. Mike wasn't too happy about this but I continued to goof off. \n\nHe finally said the words \"Moishe, you're justifying the holocaust.\"\n\nAs open to interpretation as this might seem, it was in fact quite clear what he was saying, as it had been said to me before with clearer context: I, by being a jew who was annoying him, was justifying the genocide of the people I represent. Despite what you might think, this is not what I got mad and beat him up for. I did get mad, but was thinking about a big standardized test that was the next day, which I didn't want to miss by being suspended or expelled.\n\nThe next day, after the test was over I was talking to a friend about why I was mad at Mike at that particular moment in time, and I talked about what he said to piss me off. He jokingly suggested kicking his ass, which got me thinking about what I could possibly get away with. \n\nThe next day, Friday I had the same class as on Wednesday, and was continuing to work (maybe not so hard) on the group project with him. I was still very mad about what Mike said, so I decided to recreate the circumstances. I started to goof off and antagonize him to an extent, just to get him annoyed enough to say the same thing again. The goal being *this* time I could actually physically retaliate without worrying about getting suspended before a big test. I wasn't just going to beat him up without him saying anything right then and there, I had to have enough witnesses knowing what I was beating him up for. Once I got him to say the same exact words, I started to yell at him and call him a Nazi.\n\nAdjacent to the half-black person he says the words \"At least I'm not a nigger\"\n\nI continued to yell at him more and more, this time with the full support of our half-black friend (he wasn't participating in the yelling, but it was clear he was on \"my side\")\n\nWith the attention of a solid third of the class, he says again \"Moishe, stop justifying the holocaust.\"\n\nAnd then I beat him up.\n\nI got the entire school cheering for me beating up the kid that nobody liked because he was Autistic, for saying something that I wasn't even that mad about, mostly just mad that he thought he could get away with saying it. Am I the asshole?\n\n**EDIT:** I just want to add that we both actually walked away fine, me with a bloody lip from when he threw something at me. The worst thing I did in the long run was probably the psychological impact he received by someone basically attacking him for something he said. \n\nI think it's settled that I'm the asshole, but (and sorry if saying this makes me more of an asshole) I can't say I'd handle it differently if it happened again. It's worth being an asshole if I can get someone, regardless of their mental health, to be afraid of publicly saying things that support the holocaust. \n\n**EDIT #2:**\n\n**Breakdown of the physicality, which originally I thought not to be important:**  \nMe beating him up went a little like this. I started yelling things at him and letting real rage actually get out of me. I stood up, and grabbed his chair to try to get him to face me and look me in the eye (it actually took a long time to decide whether I would go through with getting physical) but things escalated quicker than anticipated because right then and there is what actually started the fight: When I grabbed his chair, I pulled too hard and he fell right out of it, onto the floor. He took this as the \"first swing\" and quickly stood up, and in a somewhat mechanical fashion, he threw his open binder at my head, and the open rings scratched me and drew blood from my forehead and my top lip. The class (100% were watching at this point) considered this the \"first swing.\" I grabbed his shoulders and swung him around to start hitting him, but he ducked fairly quickly and all of my punches actually skimmed his back, IIRC. A girl was screaming \"stop fighting\" just like in that one Key & Peele bit, and I sort of didn't know what to do at that point to I stepped away.\n\n**What happened after the situation:**  \nAs I mentioned before, I got the whole school cheering for me and assuring me that they took my side. I went to the Vice Principle's office and he went to the head-counselor-guy's office and talked about what happened to our respective recipient. Side-note: Some of you said I should have talked to a special-ed guy about Mike's behavior, but somehow the special-ed guy didn't actually get involved at all. Both Mike and I independently agreed to having a meeting with each other, supervised by the head-counselor-guy and the Vice Principle. This is the meeting where it became quite clear to me that he knew exactly what he was saying and that he intended for it to be hurtful, not a joke. After he admitted that, he became a broken record of \"it's both of our faults, but we should forget it and move on.\"\n\nThat's it, I suppose.

She was supposed to make dinner for the family and unfortunately due to how long we were there it looked like it was not going to happen. I knew my father had a long day at work so I decided to order out for the night since I couldn't be there to cook myself.\n\nI called the house and every time I called, I was told by my father that he and my brother can wait till we get home to make the order. I texted my brother my credit card information after the first call so he can order while I'm not there. It was getting extremely late and I called one more time to have them make the order because after a certain time the place stops delivering. My father got pissed at me because I kept calling and trying to make sure dinner was taken care of and he told me to mind my business and stop calling and stop being annoying. This in turn upset me so I told my brother to forget about ordering and delete all my CC info that I gave him. I told him specifically not to use my card and **do not** buy anything.\n\nAround 10pm we are finally finished with the hospital, and my mom calls the house to check up on my father and brother. I overhear her say that food was ordered. I quickly check my bank account and I find out my money was used and it was *a lot.* To say I wasn't angry was a understatement. I was **livid.** I quickly explain to my mom why I was so angry and hurt because I was first yelled at for trying to make sure the family was fed and then my brother went behind my back and used my money after I told him not to.\n\nWhen we got home I couldn't even look at my father and brother. I went to the bathroom, took a deep breath and told myself to just suck it up and just eat my food. I sit down and the first words out of my father's mouth are \"Why is her face all twisted?\" My mom says ask me instead of her. I tell my dad I'm fine, and my mom starts explaining why I'm upset. My dad casually brushes off what she says by saying, \"Oh, well she should of just called if she didn't want us to order, and if she wanted a particular item off the menu she should of called\" I calmly put down my fork and say, \"Excuse me, I called MULTIPLE times to tell you to order not too late and you yelled at me and tole me to stop calling. Beside I told (and I pointed to my brother) him to tell you I'm not ordering anymore because of your attitude.\" That of course he didn't want to hear and proceeded to yell saying how he never yelled, and my mom cut in saying she heard him yelling at me in the hospital when I was on the phone. I told my father I did not appreciate the way he spoke me and I also mentioned that he continues to not respect anything I say. \n\nHe blew up telling me to shut the F up and I can because I'm the father, to which I screamed at him that that's not the way you speak to your daughter and it was just a constant back and forth with him getting in my face and telling me to shut up and eat my food. He then told me if I don't like it I can GTFO the house and I quote, \"IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GET A REAL JOB AND GTFO OF MY HOUSE! YOU WANT RESPECT GET OUT. I'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT AND I'M DONE\" He kept trying to get in my face to hit me but my brother was keeping him down and he finally went upstairs.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was trying to order out for the family because both my mom and I couldn't be there.

About a month later I met my current girlfriend and started dating her, problem is she wasn't from my town and people generally don't allow people who are juniors or out of town to come down to the prom houses. However there are instances where other people outside of the designated prom house come down for a bit. \n\nSo I submitted another deposit around January of $118 (although I actually gave her $120 because of ATM withdrawal) A little after this time my gf asked what we were gonna do after prom and I said I didn't know, she was kinda distraught that she wasn't going to be able to hang out with me after prom at all and I realized it was kinda fucked so at this point I told Eileen I'd go down Sunday morning (after spending Saturday night with gf) and I'd find a ride down to the shore house. I also needed to do a presentation Wednesday so I said I'd get a ride back late Monday night with one of the other people who are going back Monday night (there's lots). No problems there.\n\nFast forward to February, Eileen requests $118 ($120 again due to ATM withdrawal)again along with $70 for food and alcohol. She said this was the last payment and I was fine with that, albeit hesitant about paying that much for alcohol since I'm not a heavy drinker. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago, she says we need to pay $54 each for the bus. I figure I'd get a discounted rate since I'm only going from the pre-prom location to prom in the bus, the rest I'm gonna do myself. She told me nope and that it's $54 for both my girlfriend and I even though neither of us are taking the bus to the actual prom house (the extent of the cost). Now I was pretty upset about this not gonna lie. \n\nSo it's the week before prom and I got surgery Monday and the results came back that I can't drink at all this weekend so I asked Eileen to re-apportion my alcohol money to food instead. She said it was too late for that and I still needed to pay for the bus. The problem here is that the food we have is very minimal, only easy mac, ramen and various snacks and water. No burgers, no hot dogs, no nothing. Yet there are 28 people in the prom house and we gave her $70 EACH for alcohol AND food. Plus there's at least one other person who hasn't paid for the bus yet and he told me she hasn't said anything to him. He's also closer friends-wise with her, although when I brought it up she did say he would have to pay for the bus. But he's a heavy drinker and using the bus to get down to the shore house. Then she said if I refused to pay for the bus I would have to formally apologize in the Facebook group because she wouldn't have enough money to buy food that people want.\n\nAt this point I had an outburst because I said the food should have already been covered at this point and my bus money should have nothing to do with that, and that I'm already paying for alcohol which I won't be drinking, 3 nights for the house when I'll only be staying for 1; and now a bus I'd only use for a 15 minute ride from pre-prom to the actual prom event. \n\nOh also she suggested the idea of having her college Freshman friends come down to drink with us and then drive some people back Tuesday morning. This angered me too because she's cool with allowing them to come down whenever but not my significant other when I've deposited all this money already.\n\nAnyway Reddit I'll be happy to clarify anything for you to determine if I'm the asshole or not. Should I drive my date to prom in my car? Should I pay her and suck it up? Should I continue to insist my way on to the bus for 15 minutes without paying? \n\nEdit: Forgot this bit -  Apparently she did some mismanagement with money and some people gave her less than she had asked for in some cases but she never counted. If I'm supposed to feel bad for her fronting money because she didn't keep track of the expenses and the amount she was given - I don't. I'm not going to cover anyone else and I think it should be fair that I get to go to the bus for prom at least. She said at the start of all this it would be $220-230 per person for the house if we had 24 people; currently we have 28 and it was $236 per person for just the house.\n\n\nEdit 2: oh and earlier in the year she told me stories about how she overcharged people for alcohol since she had a fake and it was easy.

This family member is totally hopeless with computer stuff, and so often asks me, as I know how to do most stuff, to show them or explain to them how to do things. \n\nNow I'll admit first that this usually serves to really frustrate me, as really fail to understand why this person finds this sort of thing difficult when I can do it with relative ease. This is made particularly \nworse because this person keeps claiming that \"they know what they need to know\". You obviously don't if you're asking me to do shit I was able to do at 6 years old....especially when you don't even make an effort to learn. \n\nAnyway, this family member asked me if I could help them with some issue they were having with their computer. So I went to help them, and when I got there, they wanted help *sending an attachment on an email*. Emphasis mine, as I was so frustrated at their stupidity, I really wanted to cry. \n\n  Anyway, we logged into the email account, pulled up the 'new message' screen and filled in the body of the email. Then I started on sorting out the attachment. \n\nIt quickly became apparent to me that I was going to have problems. This family member didn't have a clue about using the 'browse' function of a computer, and the most basic terms like 'file' and 'format' were like I was speaking Russian. I could feel myself getting so pissed off with this person I wanted to scream, and it must have been showing. I tried my absolute hardest to give an ELI5 (or more like an ELI2) sort of level explanation, but even then it wasn't the easiest. \n\n **Situation 2** \n\n This happened a few hours after the first. I'd gone to make a piece of toast of all things, and I set the dial on the side to 3. I set it away in the toaster and went off to do something else. When I came back to it, the toaster was giving off smoke and the toast was charcoal. I realised the dial had been moved asked this family member if they knew anything about it and they said they'd adjusted the dial. I lost my temper and went on a rant about how I would expect if something was a certain way when I left it, it'd be that way when I came back, and I still can't work out the logic of someone changing it. \n\nSo, who's the asshole?

To begin with, I live overseas and in general I\u2019ve been more of an individual who values strong friendships in small numbers rather than having a great number of contacts.\n\nTo keep it short I befriended some new coworkers. For the most part I tried approaching the situation in clear conscience and did my best to build healthy ties, and for the most part as did the other two people. However I found that over time it started to feel like a 1 way relationships. While I was always welcoming and open with invitations for things like coffee or food they would, 95% of the time go un answered. I didn\u2019t think much of it simply due to the fact I go for coffee and dinner on a whim quite regularly and I don\u2019t expect people to fit my schedule, especially one that is so unplanned.\n\nThat being said, after a few months of me taking time out to build a friendship I realized almost all of my invitations went unanswered. To be fair, I didn\u2019t really bring this up and at the time it only started to crop up a bit but didn\u2019t concern me much.\n\nFlash forward a bit and I was invited by the two coworkers for a event at a local amusement park. I said I\u2019d come but on the actual morning I actually kind of caved. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it but I guess the stress of constantly having to be out and involved as an introvert the previous months combined with the fact I was living in a foreign country and putting a lot of pressure on myself lead to me curled up in bed the entire day. It wasn't my proudest morning and I have to say with all the time I've spent here it was probably my weakest.\n\nIn all fairness I didn\u2019t give a warning, didn\u2019t even check my phone, didn\u2019t respond. I simply shut the curtains and spent the next 2 days curled up in my bed. I\u2019m sure it was stress, I don\u2019t really know, all I know is that it was something that happened, and I really really needed it.\n\nOf course I felt like shit about it and didn\u2019t have the confidence to even check my phone for the two days following. When I eventually did check my phone all I saw was 2 messages, asking where I was, and if I was coming.\n\nFor the record I didn\u2019t do this for attention or any sort of affirmation or anything like that but at the same time I created a clearer picture (or so I think) of where the relationship actually stood.\n\nFollowing that incident, neither of them particularly acknowledged it, in turn neither did I and simply from there we went from talking normally to having no contact in the work place, in or out. This has continued to this day. Of course some other coworkers have confronted me on me and them are no longer friends but neither I nor the previous friends have made any effort to get past that whole silence.\n\nIt\u2019s at the point of comfort now but I try to self analyze my situations in life quite a bit. In all honesty I believe I acted poorly by not being the bigger person and trying to explain my situation when it happened. At he same time I justify it in my mind as it stood out as a chance for the other party to exemplify some sort of double sided relationship, something that ultimately didn\u2019t remotely come to fruition.\n\nI feel I\u2019m most certainly the asshole in this case but at the same time I can\u2019t see myself making any effort to resolve it at this point.

It's a bit older than I've been playing and ever since I started, I've wanted this rare costume set. It was big when a little noob but I've only been able to get the necessary in game money to purchase them a year ago. They were one of the first sets to enter the game and they're next to impossible to find now. My SO's decked out in its polar opposite, same scenario. He had wanted his set ever since he started and he's been watching the market like a hawk for the pieces. I found out that he and a friend had also been watching for the pieces that I wanted. A little while previously, they had an event where you could wear the full set I wanted for a single day. I ran around in it, enjoyed it, found that I liked the look and feel of the cheap costume that I had been wearing up until then better, and generally let my craving wash away. I told my SO this, but it seems to have slipped his memory. I first realized that he and our friend were watching the market for the pieces when they rushed excitedly to me to announce that someone was selling the top part of the costume. There are 6 costume pieces and two accessory pieces. The accessories are wonderfully expensive and completely out of my price range, the top part, bottom part, gloves, and shoes are feasible. The hair part and weapon I never expected to get. I never planned to wear the set unless I had the weapon part or else it would break up the current set that I have. All in all, I considered it a pointless endeavor. When my SO came to tell me about the piece on sale, I told him to forget about it. I didn't have enough money at the time to buy it anyway, but he did. He told me over and over to get one but I refused. Eventually after I had gone to sleep for the night, he logged onto my account, transferred the money, and bought the item. I thought, what the hell, might as well go for it now. We managed to get the gloves and shoes, but his enthusiasm dropped after that. He used to watch the board constantly for it, but now doesn't care about it at all and I learned from others that the bottom part had come for sale but it was long gone. I searched halfheartedly on my own with no luck. Now a new costume set has come and I want to attempt obtaining, but when I mentioned to my SO that I wanted to sell the costume he got for me to get it, he got upset. I told him that I hadn't wanted that costume before he got it for me nor did I want it afterwards. He had been the one truly excited about it but he puttered out and now it's rotting in my inventory. He told me that he thought I was refusing to purchase the top in the first place because I had wanted to try to get it on my own. \n\nI feel like an asshole but sometimes I just want to toss the costume on the floor and walk away from it. All it's caused me is pain.

I was uncomfortable telling my dad upfront (again, I have my reasons) so I kind of avoided the whole situation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe listed the house and sold it within 8 days. My father found out after the fact and called me about it. Conversation went like this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDad: \"You already sold your house?\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMe: \"Yes, dad.

He also confirmed that he was upset about the money (the money he would have made with the commission).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReasons I didn\u2019t want to use my dad: I used my dad as my agent when I bought my place 7 years ago. He made his full commission off of me, which is fine (I guess). Although, I know if my mother were the agent, she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to make any money off of me. Anyway, my father treated me like I received the family discount instead of as a real client. He wasn\u2019t responsive and I felt like I couldn\u2019t really ask all the questions that I would normally ask another agent. Plus, my father lives 40 miles away and doesn\u2019t really know the neighborhood and area like a local agent would. The agent we ended up using this time around was awesome! The commission was discounted (used Redfin) and he knew his stuff!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA little more background: My parents divorced when I was 4 and I\u2019ve never really been close to my father.

The primary responsibility of my team is to process orders and get the accounts set up with one of the major national home security companies.  We all have other tasks, but that's the main one.  The large majority of the time the job is divided into two parts  - two of my teammates make sure the orders are correct in our database and one of my teammates and I enter the orders from our database into the national chain's database.  \n\nLast summer, there started being a lot of errors in the accounts in our database.  All little things that are supposed to be corrected before the accounts get to me.  The problem got worse and worse and one day early last fall, I mentioned it to my two teammates.  They said they weren't aware they were missing things and would be more attentive.  Nothing changed.  The other person who primarily does what I do hadn't been so great at catching the mistakes and eventually the errors were reported to our supervisor.  She asked me to keep a list of errors I was seeing and send it to her.  I did.  She said she would talk to the teammate who was making the most mistakes but didn't know what else she could do.  Nothing changed.\n\nI kept my mouth shut and just continued to fix problems.  In April this year, I realized I was fixing problems in over 20% of the accounts I touched.  I was spending so much time re-doing their work that it was taking my focus and energy away from my actual job and my production was suffering. \n\n I struggled to find a way to bring it up without being a jerk or hurting someone's feelings and when our supervisor mentioned that we would be adding a new team member, I thought I had a safe opening.  I emailed my team (not our manager) and said \"hey, since we're adding a new person, we might want to tighten up the order processing some, it's going to be difficult to train the newbie if the account info isn't right and they're not going to know to fix those things for you guys, and that's going to cause problems when the contracts come in with the wrong information.  Here's a list of the stuff I've been fixing this week so you'll know what to be on the lookout for.\"  And I included a long list of the problems I had fixed that week, minus the names of the person responsible for each one.  I didn't want to embarrass anyone, I just wanted us to perform the way I knew we could.\n\nPeople's feelings were hurt.  They thought I was saying that they were the worst teammates on the planet and that I was making judgments about them personally.  I got the silent treatment, I got emails pointing out that I wasn't perfect (even though I never asked anyone to be perfect), I was told that a 20% error rate was the best they could do and that they were too busy to even think about making any changes.  Their defensiveness escalated to a point where I really had to stop being nice and start being bluntly honest about how bad things had been for the last year.  That made things worse and after that, I did do some assholish things like stop socializing with them and only answering work-related questions, leaving at the end of my shift without saying goodbye, etc.\n\nIt was so frustrating.  It felt like they were saying that their time was too valuable to be using 3 seconds to double-check their work for errors, but it's perfectly fine to make me spend my time doing it.  They know I will always fix their problems, because if I don't, we both get in trouble.  And I'm a fucking team player.  \n\nTo be effective, we need to work as a team, so eventually I just said whatever and told them I would adjust my expectations and let it go.\n\nSince then, the problem has progressively gotten worse.  I'm now fixing errors in over 30% of the accounts I touch. I don't know of another data entry job you could do in which an error rate that high would be acceptable.\n\nTheir inability to even recognize that there was a problem made me feel like not being a part of that team any longer.  When a position in another area of the office opened up, I expressed interest and the manager of that team was so excited that I had, she didn't even interview me, she just said the position was mine.  \n\nNow my teammates think I am an asshole for leaving the team and making them hire and train two new people to replace me.  I would rather stay on the team, but I've reiterated my concerns and they still don't see that there's a problem or that they can do anything about it.  So, I'm taking a job that is going to be horribly boring to get away from them and am hoping to find something outside the company sooner rather than later.  \n\nWas I an asshole to want my team to perform at their best?  Was I an asshole for bringing up my concerns?  Am I an asshole for wanting to be treated fairly?  Am I an asshole for abandoning the team?

She very quickly proposed an open relationship which I said no but it didn't matter because it was \"her body\" and she could do whatever she wanted.

So I finally concede and say doesn't matter but if she gets involved with someone else she needs to tell me so I can leave because Im not interested in having that in my relationship. She agrees.\n\nAnother important note about this is that I could never really tell if she had any serious interest in me because she hated romance and gestures.

All she had to do was say \"oh, can you deal with this please?\" if she did, and she made no attempt. \n\n* It took her **5 days** to make the complaint.

I would actually have had more respect for her if she'd done so rather than hiding behind someone else's skirt.

She's a bitch, she's trying to ruin my life now, and I (at the very least) don't want to be on the hook for this woman...\n\nWhat do!?!\n\n[EDIT]\n\nIt seems there are some comments that I haven't painted the whole picture, and that may be true indeed. But I didn't want to write my memoirs on here. I tried to give the basics without going into too much detail. Basically, our relationship started out with a lot of trust issues. Communication was always a bit of a problem, seeing we we had different first languages. She lied to me about seeing a guy at a bar, it was innocent, but the fact she had to lie and never apologized about it was rather disappointing.\n\nFast forward, we get married (things are not perfect, but no signs of major cracks) She stops having sex with me (this was the reason for this throwaway account.. i was lurking on /r/deadbedrooms), doing basic chores, just 'existing' but all the while critizising me. I suggest we go to counseling (for the third time. when I brought it up before she was aggressive and hesitant but claimed that she willing to go so long as I did all the leg work (basically she said she'd show up).\n\nWe did go (after arriving in Canada), showed no willingness to work together and try. She refused to communicate with me, tell me what she is feeling. She says she wants to stop wearing her wedding ring (now that she finally found a job). She said it was because it was \"uncomfortable\" or didn't want a tan line (since it was spring/summer). When finally i got it out of her, it was she wanted a separation.\n\nAnd so, here we are today. Her sexual neglect (and my inability to cope with it..?) and our terrible communication lead to the destruction of our marriage. If she married me only to come to Canada... then idk what the fuck to do.\nI just don't want to get into shit.\n\nAs an aside, I have spoken to our immigration lawyer who we used to process her visa. He said she'd face immigration charges, but neither of us should have criminal charges. And (although he doesn't handle divorce) because of our situation, the divorce proceedings should be super simple. He said we could do it ourselves.. Still going to get a second opinion form a divorce lawyer.\n", "score": 28, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3abmma", "name": "t3_3abmma", "created_utc": 1434657434.0, "title": "AITA for not saying goodbye to my ex?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\na few weeks ago my then-gf confessed that she cheated on me (repeatedly).

When this guy is in a bad mood or if we've called him out on being stupid about something (not in a bad way but I understand that from his perspection it may seem like we're acting more smart than him and that makes him feel dumb) time passes by and when you say something normal he just says Shut Up (most of the time, sometimes he says other stuff) to me (not the other guys for the most part). It annoys me so much because there is no reason for saying that to your friends. Keep in mind that when we call him out we only explain the more logical way of thinking but like I previously said that probably sounds like we're mean to him from his perspective. Also because we're more people against him alone. \n\nAnyways this last night he said ''Gay'' to one of my normal texts in the chat randomly. I replied ''Don't be an old granny (referring to being bitter) and type Shut Up, it shows thay you're bitter and moody'' (he had been saying that previously this night). He replies with ''Gay'' again. I tell him that he acts like a little kid and has no logic. He replies with ''Eat poop''. Saying stuff like this could be funny when you were like 15 but we've grown out of it, except he hasn't. The words he usually uses are Shut Up though. When I call him out on acting like a kid he often says that he's just joking. It's obvious that he isn't and that he just lets out his inner aggression feelings on me in this chat when he's having a bad day.\n\nI want to know if I'm the asshole here since I feel like a bully sometimes because he's all alone in his opinions and actions while I have backup from my friends.

I ended up getting arrested and really saw my life for what it was, moved hours away, quit drinking and experimenting, mended my bad relationships with my family, graduated a year early, and am enrolled in college next semester. I'm so much happier with myself and don't really see the need to try other things that I know will harm my body becuase theres more to life than getting fucked up. Hes told me in the past that he's not comfortable with the drugs ive done and that he would break up with me without a  second thought if I ever touched cocaine or acid, which I think is pretty reasonable. I don't exactly want him into those things either. He's recently found a new group of friends and says he doesn't want me around them because, they're \"not accepting people\" and even had a birthday party that he didn't tell me about or invite me to with all of them the other day. A few daya ago he told me that he wanted to try cocaine and that we should do it together. I am not comfortable with cocaine at all and told him that. He says his friends were on it a few days before and they just looked so happy. I said I wasn't really comfortable with his friends doing cocaine around him. Last night he was staying over and his friend called him and asked him to come try cocaine, this made me very uncomfortable and I said \"I'm not sure if I like your friends, they seem like bad influences on you and I know you'd tell me the same thing. I'm just not comfortable with it.\" He starts to ignore me even being in the room until he finally tells me that I way too judgmental and that he's not staying at my house. I offered to let him sleep in my bed and I'd go on the couch and we could drop the situation right now. I beg him to just talk to me about it while he literally completely ignores my presence until saying that \"talking never works\" and things to that nature. I tried to stress that communication is pretty much the most important thing in a relationship and that we obviously need to talk about this problem. I said what I said because I'm not comfortable with hard drugs and feel like he's choosing his friends over me not because I'm trying to be judgemental. He then left with the friends that called him and probably did cocaine. \nTL;DR boyfriend who was against drugs gets a call and decides he wants to go do cocaine. That's a little shady and I say that. I'm mean and judgmental and should beg him to come back.

I was extremely close with the one (we'll call her Kay), and good friends with the other two (we'll call them Ali and Jess).  Ali is the friend I'm talking about now.  After we graduated we all went off to colleges in different states and slowly grew apart.  Jess dropped off the face of the earth completely, and I vaguely kept in email contact with Kay and Ali.  Ali dropped out and moved back home, but she worked really hard and has an awesome job, so she's been doing well.  I never thought I'd move back even remotely close to where I grew up, but I ended up going to graduate school about 2 hours away from where I grew up, and I reconnected with Ali.  We grew up in a small town, so she always wanted to come visit me to come to the big city, and I would visit her occasionally, but not nearly as often as she would come to see me.  Typically her visits involved her going to some event, like a concert or sporting event and she would crash at my place.\n\n\nSo the start of the fall out started a few years ago when I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was really sick and in the hospital and I talked to her about visiting, she said she was slammed at work and couldn't make it, but she sent a card and a gift.  No big deal, I totally understood.  Fast forward about six months, she came into town to visit, I was on the mend.  We go out to lunch and I was telling her how hard everything had been, she says now that I've opened up she should as well.  That she had been lying about being single for all these years, and that she'd actually had a boyfriend for about two years.  She said the reason she hadn't told me was because it was scandalous, and I was thinking maybe he was married or something.  Then she tells me its because he's black.  I found this really offensive, because I could care less about that, and if she knew me at all she would know that.  I brought up that Jess is black and dated white guys and none of us thought anything of that, so why would this be any different.  She was like oh well I just didn't know if you were racist or not.  So I was already mad, but then she tells me that she's been coming to town about every week with him to go to events and stuff, but never told me because she didn't want me to know about him.  So she didn't come visit me when I was in the hospital with cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend.\n\n\nThe second strike is our beach trip a few months later.  We had already planned and paid for it when I found this out, so I decided to suck it up and try to make it as fun as possible.  We go out one night, I drove and was DD, she proceeds to get trashed, and cause a scene at the bar we were at.  She invited two guys back to our place even though we both have boyfriends, and I had to tell them they were not actually invited and to leave us alone, and she starts yelling at me about how I'm such a worrier and that nothing was going to happen and I'm no fun, etc etc.  I drove us back to our condo and I was pissed.  I mostly read on the beach the next day, and I didn't drive us to go back out, and then I went straight home.  \n\n\nStrike three for me was kinda two things together, but they were similar.  The first was her coming to visit to go to something during the day and wanted me to go with her, I told her I had to work and couldn't.  I worked all day and then went out that night, and she thought this was rude because I said I couldn't hang out.  Then I was supposed to see her before Thanksgiving and ended up having to work, I warned her a week in advance that I wouldn't be able to make it, and she told me to text her the day of to confirm.  I said ok, but then I forgot, because I was focused on work, and at 4pm she texted me and said \"I guess you're not coming\" I told her that I had already let her know and was going to text her when I got home.  I apologized and said that maybe I didn't come across clear, but that I thought I had let her know.  She said that our friendship doesn't seem like a priority to me and that I'm a shitty friend.  So I told her if that's how she feels then great, but I don't care because I'm done being friends with someone who treats me the way that she does.  I haven't talked to her again since.\n\n\nRecently, she has been emailing saying she misses me and wants to move past everything and be friends again.  I don't have any interest in trying to work through that with her, and I'd rather her not be in my life.  Am I being the asshole?  Should I try to work things out?  Was I wrong?  Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR; My longtime friend didn't visit me when I had cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend because she didn't know if I was racist (I'm not), she was a drunken rude mess on our beach trip, and told me I'm a shitty friend for having to cancel on her because of work, am I the asshole for ending our friendship and not wanting to mend it?", "score": 15, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3b9icg", "name": "t3_3b9icg", "created_utc": 1435370914.0, "title": "AITA for not being able to handle my best friend's constant depression?", "link_flair_text": "no assholes here", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3bbvi6", "name": "t3_3bbvi6", "created_utc": 1435432000.0, "title": "AITA for not letting my sister borrow my car?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "I'm 19, my sister is 32.\n\nMy parent gave my car to me at the start of my Senior year of high school as my early graduation present.

They hate Jesus, but they hate us even more now. Don't you know they execute homosexuals?\"\n\nI simply respond by saying that true muslims do not hate Jesus. They in fact recognize him as a prophet much like Jewish people recognize him as a prophet, just not as their messiah.\n\nAnyways, we get into it about how Muslims and Jews don't follow the \"one true path in Christ\" and how \"I'd be surprised how many jews hate Christians.\" I did a bit of quick research and posted a rather lengthy response that reads:\n\n\n\"You'd be surprised how many Christians hate other Christians.\n\n\nEverything that you read in the New Testament about Jesus and Moses and any link between the two is not going to affect the views of a born, raised, and practicing Jewish person. In their hearts, Jewish people believe that they have been following the teachings of Moses (the 5 books) and that the Messiah has yet to come. For them, Jesus was not the Messiah. There are a lot of vague things that may be interpreted in many ways in every religious text, which is why we get extremist groups that seek to destroy other religions and only seek the betterment of their own religion. This vagueness also accounts for the writings of Moses about the Messiah and why Jewish people refuse to accept Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus says in the new testament that Moses talked about him, but he was never directly named or mentioned by Moses. It was left up to an entire religion to determine what Moses meant when he gave the conditions for the prophecy. \n\nAnyway, the three monotheistic religions teach about Abraham and his descendants. They also teach about prayer and dedicating ones' life to its teachings. The difference seems to be cut off at the beginning of the New Testament. Christians believe in the old & new testaments combined. Jewish people believe in the writings of the Torah (partially the old testament), and Muslims believe the teachings of the Quran (which largely resembles the Old Testament up to a point). You can speak as bitterly as you want to about every religion other than your own, but if you continue to spread a message that says that other religions are hateful and silly to follow, you will turn away more people from Christianity than you will convert.\n\nMy (probably unwelcome) suggestion is that you take a religion class that focuses on other monotheistic religions so that you may actually understand the positions of other religions instead of only following what you hear from other conservative Christians and focusing on how hateful and wrong other religions are. You can learn a lot from another religion and not have to practice it, which is a beautiful thing about theism.\"\n\n\nI don't normally post religious shit like this on facebook and I feel like an asshole for calling this guy out.

I decided to try to do something productive so I went to go take out the trash and then go clean the barn. I went outside and got in the truck to head out. As I opened the door one of their dog's jumped in the back as usual, no problem... Until I got to the barn, forgot the dog was in their and locked him in the blazing summer sun.

I opened the truck door to hear him panting and whimpering and immediately realized I fucked up.

I'm in a panic... Realizing he is burning I decide he needs water. I drive him back to the hose to pour cold water all over him and attempt to make him drink some. Then I see a truck. Thank God! One of my cousin's is back. I run to tell him what happened. He comes over as fast as he can and at this point I think the dog has bitten his tongue because he is bleeding from the mouth. As we drive to the vet I tell my cousin that I had found him like this by the pond(to explain the wetness) We got him to the vet and they told us that his insides had burned up from the heat. We got a call back the next day for them to tell us he died. We then drive back to pick up the body.

The post was from a political party that simply stated that for every $1 earned, women would earn $0.81.\n\nThat fact though, has nothing to do with equal pay. It just says that on a nation wide average, men earn more than women. It is a fact so entirely vague that it doesn't have any validity in backing up their views that pay is unfair. For example, what if you removed the (largely male dominated) super rich?\n\nFor my trouble, I was called out by three good friends who claimed that I was confused between the gender pay gap and the gender wage gap (one deals with promotions, the other with actual $ to $ pay for the same job for different genders).\n\nThese three people (two cis women and my agender sister) continually posted on my post, moving the conversation from one side to the other, saying things about the glass ceiling jobs, in dangerous jobs, and how they believed that feminists were being given a bad name by all those men hating \"feminists\".\n\nI took my time to research and argue my case against certain points, only to be \"nitpicking\". I pointed out that women aren't allowed to serve in my country's army, and that I thought this was wrong - that if there is a fitness test for front line male soldiers, all the women would have to do is pass an equally tough result. IE both of them have to be able to run a mile in X minutes, where X = x, and X is minutes for men, x is minutes for women. However this point didn't matter, because my friend who had made the post about women not being allowed into dangerous jobs apparently doesn't care about dangerous jobs, despite literally just mentioning it. My sister also called me out on my false \"moving the goal posts\" statement - something that I did not mention. I did not mention any requirements changing, I know for a fact women in my country cannot serve dedicated front line jobs (we have things like front line medics, but they're not designed to be the actual front line), and my knowledge on the fact that men and women have differing fitness requirements for non-front line jobs comes from my agender sister's own military fitness book that we used to exercise from.\n\nAt this point, my sibling claimed that she was \"disappointed\" in me, saying that my views were very \"Daily Mail inspired\" and \"MRA-esque\". Despite the fact that they know  the only thing I read from the Daily Mail is Garfield, and that my \"MRA\"-ness goes as far as old school feminism where I want equal for both genders. Sometimes, as a man, I'll talk about where society fails us, like education.\n\nAt this point she continued to insult me and then said that she was too tired to continue to \"educate\" me, asking the other two girls to do the job. Apparently no amount of \"back-peddling\" or \"I'm on your side\" would help.\n\nIn this entire debacle, only two people used sources, my sibling and myself. I was accused of only doing \"15 minutes\" of research, despite spending over an hour on a single government piece solely about this subject.

Two employees, one boss, and the boss' lackey.  There is a big, family sized fridge in the kitchen area that is--at most--1/3 full with everyone's stuff.  Some of us like the same things, like single serve (12 oz) bottles of diet coke, but nobody labels their stuff or steals because we all know what we brought in, and if we can't tell the difference between one bottle or another, we don't take more than we brought, and everything evens out.  \n\nSo today, I open one of two absolutely full bottles of diet coke, and don't think I heard much of a fizz but didn't think much of it and had a sip.

On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I \"didn't want to have anything to do with that.\"  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.\n\nAnyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, \"That was highly inappropriate,\"  I said back, \"Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...\"  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, \"You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.\"\n\nNow, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, \"Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.\"  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.\n\nLet me give you a little back story, so you know the context.\n\nI've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.\n\nWe have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.\n\nShe didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.\n\nI brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?\n\nTL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would \"fucking kill me\".

That's why this will probably sound stupid.\n\nLast year I dated this girl, let's call her Allie. Allie was..well..kind of a nymphomaniac. She'd been with more guys than she could remember, and she's done basically everything. If you think I'm exaggerating..I won't go into graphic detail, but it's more than any of you are thinking.\n\nIn contrast, I had yet to go beyond kissing a girl, and was, honestly, super excited. However, we both had big issues with depression, and so I ended up breaking up with her after about two months. The reason for this is that she was incredibly attached to me, and she was becoming unhealthily obsessed. I knew she'd never be truly happy if she depended on me as a crutch, so I tried to stand by her as a friend, telling her that maybe once we'd figured ourselves out we could try again.\n\nLater that year, she disappeared. Signed out of every class, just...gone. It honestly messed me up really badly. I was 90% sure that she'd killed herself. No social media updates, no indicators at all. I moved on with life, and had a couple other casual relationships, but they always felt kind of empty. All the time apart made me realize how badly I actually needed her as much as she'd needed me.\n\nFlash forward to about a month ago, and I see that she's updated Facebook again. I messaged her immediately, and we made plans to hang out. Turns out she'd gone to a mental health facility for teens, and she would be moving back within a month. We meet up, at the topic of dating gets brought up. She says that when she moves back (she was visiting home) in around a month, then we can try again. However, she says *once she's settled back in* we'll try again. Now, I was fine with this, because of course she'll need readjusting time. \n\nShe moved back almost 20 days ago, which is to my mind, adequate settling in time. No worries though, I totally respect that she has some things left to sort through. The difficult part is finding out what she's been doing during that time- the answer being multiple other guys. I guess she thinks since we aren't dating again yet, there's no commitment, and I suppose that's true. However, She knows that we might get back together soon, and is still just fucking everyone who asks. (Her reputation gets around.) I held out on \"serious\" (high school) relationships waiting for her to get back, and I feel kind of violated knowing that she's banging everyone in sight. I feel kind of betrayed, and I want to break things off, but multiple people have said that since we aren't officially dating yet, it shouldn't bother me.\n\nSo reddit, am i the asshole?", "score": 5, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3c58ah", "name": "t3_3c58ah", "created_utc": 1436048883.0, "title": "Am I the asshole for not making my sub private when I found out about the /u/chooter/ protest?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "Now that I've read more about it, I still think we shouldn't have gone private. Basically, as moderators of a sub, if we do that in protest, it would imply to readers that we have some inside knowledge or expert perspective that makes us an authority on this subject, and I have no such knowledge. Ours is a small sub; so small that I have never expected any direct access to site admins or corporate leaders, so I don't know what the people at AskReddit may know about how they fail to do this. Also, I don't understand the tools we have as sub mods well enough to complain about their inadequacy. (I can't even get our logo to show up where it belongs!)\n\nThe one gripe I do understand is the requirement that reddit sets global (and sometimes poorly explained) reddiquette and demands all subs force their commenters to comply, even when it conflicts with the sub's purpose. That's already been a thorn in our side, but I really don't resent corporate leadership's position on this. Sure, the rules could be written more clearly, but in today's oversensitive culture and litigious climate, corporations have to put some pretty stringent shackles on people's actions on their forum or in their name just to avoid being publicly scapegoated into exile, sued out of existence, or criminally prosecuted. That's the nature of being a large operating entity.\n\nAnd sure, from my perspective, the sudden firing and failure to immediately transition /u/chooter/'s position seems awkward and arbitrary, but I literally don't know the first thing about what went on.  I've known of no statement made about why she was fired, or why the speed of transition needed to be rushed.\nSo as a subreddit mod, I think making such an official move to protest ought be done with more consideration than the average Facebooker sharing a Kony video or putting a rainbow filter on his profile pic because everyone else is doing it.

We'd sell the house and each get some of the money.\n\nA couple of weeks later, some people from the same charity were at a supermarket I was shopping at. I thought 'screw it' and bought a few more tickets for myself. It was for a good cause and I didn't think any more of it.\n\nUntil just under a month ago when I got a call saying that one of those tickets had won second prize. A $25,000 dollar car, or gold bullion of equal value. I went with the bullion and that was easily sold. I needed the money badly. But I made the mistake of telling my family that I won.\n\nNow they're all saying that I went behind their backs and bought more tickets. That I should share the winnings since we agreed to share the winnings of the other tickets we'd bought together.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to give them a share of those winnings? The tickets we bought together weren't the winning ones and the tickets that did win, weren't bought 'behind their backs', whatever they say. On the other hand, I know my mum is hurting for money just as much as I am, and I'm definitely being made to feel guilty about it, even if it's not a huge win like the house would have been.

The pedestrian walkway starts in a residential area and all parking spots around the residential area are for cars with permit only. I drove around until the parking spots didn't require a permit and I parked in the first spot I found (in front of the house above).

Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others.

Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\n\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half.

So they said it again that they are doing titties, this time I knew they meant chest, so I said \"don't say you're doing titties say you're doing chest\" the guy responses \"I'm doing your mom\" and that's when I had enough off of it and left I couldn't stand it. \n\nI feel bad now for telling them to fuck off even though I know they were just playing aroynd.

Now, I don't see some of them at all, and some I rarely get to see. This post is specifically about two friends (Ryan and Mike) who are keeping something from me that I completely know about.\nI used to hangout with another friend (Ash), but I don't keep in contact with him now. He's the kind of person who will be friendly around you, but will never want to talk to you or invite you to things  if he doesn't need to/loses interest. He used to invite me to all his small events, but nowadays he is throwing parties constantly, and Ryan and Mike are constantly going. I knew this because Ash posts pictures on Snapchat, so I'm always seeing these. So on top of the fact that I don't get invited, I also have to tap through a photo collection featuring Ryan and Mike partying with Ash.\nThe thing is, Ryan and Mike won't admit they're doing anything with Ash. I asked them what they did the day after the party, and they just say they did nothing. They're intentionally hiding the fact that they're going, and especially the fact that I don't get invited to their events. This hurts, because I asked Ryan if Ash does anything anymore, and he says that Ash hasn't been doing anything recently. They won't admit anything's happening, \n\nSo this is where the AITA comes in:\nLately I've been hosting movie nights, because Ryan once mentioned that he'd like to start them. At first, I was planning on having Ryan and Mike over for them, because I didn't yet know they were lying to me. Now, I only invite friends I made from college, as well as the few high-school friends who I still keep in contact with. I intentionally try not to invite Ryan and Mike. They might already know I'm doing this, but they haven't said anything about it.\n\ntl;dr - Am I the asshole for leaving out two friends from movie night because they don't want to admit they go party with someone whose intentionally leaving me out?", "score": 17, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3cgmii", "name": "t3_3cgmii", "created_utc": 1436297246.0, "title": "AITA for not inviting my brothers to a sporting event?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3cj7k8", "name": "t3_3cj7k8", "created_utc": 1436348279.0, "title": "AITA for just trying to have a discussion?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3cj80f", "name": "t3_3cj80f", "created_utc": 1436348670.0, "title": "AITA for yelling at my mother", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "So yesterday, me and my mother were getting along very well, making jokes and having a good time.

But if you want more details I can provide. I'm 21 (just graduated college) and my brother is 17. \n\nMy mom and I were estranged for about 8 years until very recently. The reason for this reconnection was that my grandma (mom's mom) was going through a lot of health issues and with death as a possible outcome, wished for everyone to set aside their grudges and get along. I do so to honor my beloved grandma and start talking to my mom again. \n\nA few months pass after we reconcile and we suddenly find out that my mom has stage 4 colon cancer. That same day she is going in for surgery and I book flight tickets to Texas for me and my little brother (who is fondest of her) ASAP. Some cousins and uncles also drive out there to see her. \n\nWhen me and my brother go see her she's happy and annoyed that we came to see her. Understandable, as it was expensive to rent a car and fly out next day. I let it pass because I know how cheap and selfless she can be. Whatever. But then she continues to lecture us about our life choices, like why I didn't become a doctor or nurse, that I should dump my boyfriend because he's into music, that my brother needs a haircut etc. I kind of let these comments pass. As in I don't snap at her like I usually do and just tell her that these are the decisions we made and are happy with it. These comments continue for the next five days while me and my brother are sleeping in the same hospital room as her sharing a cot. By the end of it I was glad to leave for my planned vacation, but I still replied to these comments civilly as I sadly realize she's lecturing us while she still can. And of course, she is polite and friendly to the cousins and uncles who showed up for one day. \n\nMy little brother stays behind as the whole family thought it would be best for someone to stay with my mom for support. I was leaving for a planned trip, but was going to come back to Texas afterwards (~1.5 weeks). The cousins and uncles have work so they could not. \n\nWithin a few days, I get a call from my mom complaining about my brother's behavior. I talk to him, and realize she was just exaggerating and causing a fuss. A day or so later I get texts from my brother complaining about how my mom is being really bitchy. Saying things like how her kids don't really love her and that she loves the cousins more than us, her kids. Then I get a text from her saying how I need to fly my brother out of there because he's bothering her and making her cancer spread faster. \n\nThat was the last straw. I texted her a reply defending my brother basically. And that if she didn't stop being a bitch she'd alienate all her children (my older sister doesn't talk to her much either). I haven't heard from her since. Or any news from my brother. \n\nI'm supposed to be driving back in a few days but things got complicated again as my boyfriends cousin just died and we have to make it back in time for the funeral. My brother thinks I should just stay where I am, but I want to come out to support him (I think it's unhealthy for him mentally to deal with her alone) and the rest of my family is expecting me to drive out there because I already said I would. But I also don't want to go because I'm sick of dealing with this shit. \n\nNow I don't know if I'm an ass for not wanting to deal with my mother with cancer. Even if I do drive out, I want to let her family deal with her and leave me alone. \n\nTldr; my mom has cancer but has been bitchy to me and my brother while dealing with her.

I recently read \"Beyond the Beautiful Forevers,\" which is about life an a slum in Mumbai and a lot about the corruption in India.  There is a part about the people in the slums using corrupt methods to get money from Western charities and use it for different purposes.  According to this book, and in fact some of our experience doing business in India, bribes and corruption aren't just part of the fabric of the culture and economy there - they ARE the culture and economy, and it made me really question whether charity work can be done *at all* in the way we try to do it from the US.  \n\nSo I posted about it on FB (in a general sense, not mentioning my former job although everyone knows what it was and why the topic was interesting to me).  Someone asked specifically about my former org, and I responded \"I have no idea...I have met the staff from India and they seem professional and like they are doing a good job, and we have checks and balances and good governance in place because we do have experience with corruption in India, but if EVERYONE is in cahoots, as it seems they are from this book, then there's no real way to know, is there?\"    I was being honest.  I wasn't a marketing person, don't do spin, and I was mostly just reacting to this very disturbing book in what I consider a somewhat personal, not professional venue.    There were a lot of serious responses, including one from a friend who does mission work in Kenya, agreeing about the difficulty of working in a corrupt country where you really can't tell.\n\nSo my former boss responds to that thread,  asking if I'm doing drugs or drinking a lot in a really nasty, confrontational way, and I responded to her, all earnest, saying that the book was really disturbing and it was making me think a lot and reframe in my mind stuff that I thought was one way, but that could have been completely different...and she called me and yelled that I was saying to the whole world that everything she had been working on and for for the last 6 years was a lie.  I tried to respond that no, I wasn't saying that *at all* but she was too pissed and hung up on me after saying some really nasty stuff.  I tried to apologize and ended up deleting the entire post but I feel like shit.  \n\nI don't use Facebook for professional stuff *at all,* even though they tried for years to make us post their marketing campaigns and solicit for donations through our personal social media.  To ME, Facebook is a place to share thoughts, books, have conversations (light and heavy) and I was using it that way.  Was I an asshole or just should have known better or was that fine and she overreacted because I hit a nerve?  AITA?  \n\nEDIT:  Thanks guys, I ended up deleting the post and posting an apology/explanation, saying that I didn't intend to question our staff or organization.

We became friends via being in the same classes in our local Polytechnic. \n\nThere is this guy whom I say call as 'Luke' who is the oldest among us. He have a rather poor habit of having poor time management and impatient too, meaning that he would frequently make us wait for him and would kick up a fuss if we don't while similarly kicking up a fuss if either one of us is late. Now I won't call this a big issue since I find the rest of my friends to have the same tendency too.\n\nAnother thing is that Luke also dislike us meeting other friends instead of 'our group'. I feel that this sometimes put me in a tight spot because I like to hang out with my other group of friends and partner from time to time. The rest are sometimes given remarks for meeting their other friends too and are annoyed. At this point I should make it clear that he is not shy of making other friends and in fact has other social circles too that we do not bash him for when he meets them.\n\nSo one day the last straw was had when another guy from the group (Let's call him 'Ben') decides to meet up with Luke for dinner. After waiting for 2 hours, Ben got fed up and left. This was the third time it happen and the group finally decided to ignore and separate away from him.\n\nAs for me, I never dealt with the lateness before (He is always on time when meeting me and if he did happen to be late, he would offer to drive me home.) and his little remarks about me meeting others did not bother me at all as I myself understand that it is sometimes disappointing to see your friends choosing to meet others instead of you. So I continued to chat with him and meet up for lunch or supper from time to time. \n\nNow the issue:\n\nBen's group now heard about it and seem to be upset about my 'betrayal' despite me still hanging out and eating with them the whole time. I told them that what Luke did wasn't an issue to me as he personally did not upset me in anyway and I do not want to break a friendship just because I had to choose a side. They seem to accept my stance on the matter but would keep on making remarks about me being friends with Luke.\n\nA month since it all started has passed and I am still spending my time with both sides, though I had decided to spend more time with a group of friends who share similar passions and my partner.\nBoth sides just feels so 'lame' with their constant badmouthing and remarks but I sometimes wonder if I was the asshole in choosing not to be sympathetic and not selecting a side to be with.\n\nSo tell me dear /u/, should I have picked a side? Was I doing the right thing by staying away from it? Or maybe I was an asshole for telling someone who is upset with the other that I shall still be friends with him because I do not face the same issues?\n\n(Sorry for the long post ><\")\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR; Friend perceived as an asshole is now 'kicked' from the group, I still stay friends with both side because it is not my issue and now the group keeps taunting me about it and treats me as a 'betrayer'.", "score": 6, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3darns", "name": "t3_3darns", "created_utc": 1436906738.0, "title": "AITA for wanting to be liked?", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "My friend of 3 years hasn't been speaking to me a lot lately. I've been trying to keep in touch and hang out but gotten almost no response. Finally today, after a comment thread on FB with other people as well, he tells me we can't hang out one on one bc he's a guy and I'm a girl and he doesn't want to hurt his new girlfriend. He says it in a condescending way that implies he doesn't want to see me at all any more so I replied a little snarkily that I had been wanting to hang out in a group and that if he didn't want to be friends any more I would have appreciated prior notice before he started acting like this and ignoring my texts. I thought he was just being a little rude and it would blow over in five minutes. Then he proceeded to tell me that in fact he didn't want to be friends any more because I'm a bad influence on him. He says I am a flirt and that I enjoy the social influence that buys me. He also says I am manipulative and play mind games with people and have hurt a lot of my friends, and that it feels like I've been trying to keep him and his girlfriend apart.\n\nHe gave me no specific examples of who I had hurt or what I had specifically said. I have been told that I come across as a flirt before, but my personality is just to be friendly with people and joke around and tease them-- I'm not being touchy-feely with them, or complimenting their appearance, or anything like that, just trying to be friendly and banter. But nobody except him has accused me of doing that on purpose to have more power over people or to hurt them. As for his relationship, I've let him literally cry on my shoulder about this girl. I've suggested before when they were broken up that maybe he should move on but told him that it was his decision to make and that I would support him no matter what.\n\nI will admit that I do work really hard to try and be a charming and well-liked person. I have tried to become better friends with \"cool\" people because I'm tired of being seen as a super weird girl and a loser. I don't think that I'm better than other people who are nerdy and stuff-- I freely admit I'm a huge nerd and most of my friends are as well. And those are the people I still spend the vast majority of my time with. I just really want to be liked, and honestly sometimes it feels like a break to be away from some of my friends who attract attention with their awkwardness. I know it's shallow of me. Sometimes when I do nice things I don't do them just because I want to be helpful, but because I want a better relationship with the person or because I want to be a good person and want to be known for that.\n\nAnd I'm really afraid that that makes me a manipulator, or that I really am hurting everybody I know all the time and they just don't tell me. I have been confronted before when I have done something specific to someone and immediately apologized and worked to fix things, but it has not been for anything this guy is talking about. I asked other friends about this situation and they all said that no, I'm not manipulative and that this guy is being mean, but I really just want an outside perspective. I'm losing our entire friendship over this until he decides I'm a better person (yes, he said that). We have the same friend groups, we're on the same quiz team, and we're in the same social club, so all of this is going to be messy and awkward and I don't know what to do now. Am I the asshole or is he?\n\nTL;DR I thought I was being friendly and dealing with my mistakes when they happened. Friend says I'm a manipulator and a bad influence who hurts everyone.

This is a long thread, so grab some popcorn and have fun judging (if it's important, the city is NYC):\n\nMONDAY \n\nSam: Here's a new one: homeless guy at Frozen Yogurt Place pulling the handles and eating the froyo out of his hand\n\nTaylor: It's sort of brilliant. What flavor was he getting?\n\nSam: Birthday cake of course. I was disgusted.\n\nTaylor: There is a homeless man who always hangs out outside of my bagel shop. He just stands there looking completely catatonic and I want to buy him a bagel every day but I'm scared of him. Like I don't want him to follow me. But I also think it would probably do him wonders to know someone cares about him. \n\nSam: I'm so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. Just too many around the city\n\nTaylor: Most of them are very sick\n\nSam: Yes, that's true and a problem. I just can't stand the one per day at least on my train asking for money. \n\nSam: [sends picture of man sleeping in breezeway of bank where ATMs are] This was last week: someone sleeping inside the bank across the street. \n\nTaylor: I'd rather not have homeless people all about. It makes me feel unsafe, because I know they are likely mentally ill, but also very desperate. But I think as human beings, we're called to have a little compassion.\n\nSam: Have you ever run into a hostile one on the train? Not pleasant\n\nTaylor: I know it's not. I don't want to deal with it any more than you do. But I don't know, to hear that you feel no sympathy and that you're disgusted makes me sad.\n\nSam: Not true of the mentally ill ones. That's a sickness. But a large portion seem to be just fine asking for money on the same train multiple times a week with the same sob story. \n\nSam: Anyway, do you like Indian food?\n\nTaylor: I've never really had Indian food\n\nSam: Neither have I but I'm curious\n\nSam: Would you want to try it sometime? It's got to be vegetarian-friendly\n\nTaylor: I would try it...if you'll try volunteering at the homeless shelter with me some weekend\n\nSam: I'm not opposed to it. How are they related though?\n\nTaylor: Because how the poor are treated is important to me. We both want the same thing...less people on the streets, less begging...so why not be proactive about it? Do something good to help people? \n\nSam: I feel the poor & working are much different than the poor and refusing to work. And again, mentally ill notwithstanding. \n\nTaylor: I agree, but it's a pretty strong statement to say you have zero sympathy and all disgust you. I sincerely doubt that guy sleeping in a bank is just refusing to work. I also think just think a lot of the time people have issues that we don't understand. Anyway, all I'm saying is I have felt strongly compelled to help the poor lately. I actually was planning on calling the shelter to set up a time to volunteer anyway this week. So let's do something nice for others bc both of us are pretty fortunate\n\nSam: Part of me does want to always help those who are less fortunate. But another part says, \"get a job.\" That's the no sympathy part. If millions of immigrants can come here illegally and work hard selling fruit along the highway, so can the dummy on the train \n\nTaylor: We just don't know the circumstances of these people. Plenty of people abuse the system. And that, in my opinion, is gross. But there are plenty of people who seem fine who truly can't get a job [redacted because of a personal story]. I'm not saying every person is a sob story, nd there are definitely gross, horrible people out there, but defaulting to place of no compassion isn't a good look for anyone. \n\nSam: I was very clear that any mental disability is notwithstanding. You're giving a free pass to too many who just refuse to work. Ride the train with me sometime and we'll count how many are qualified to sell fruit on the highway. It'll be 9 out of 10. \n\nTaylor: I'm not giving a free pass to anyone. I am saying that it's our job to be compassionate human beings and do what we can take make sure our fellow humans are treated with dignity. I'm not saying handouts, I'm just advocating for not judging and not looking at people we don't know with disgust because we don't know their story. That's all. \n\nSam: Well I bet your compassion level would be muuuuch different if you rode 4 trains a day in the city, or lived on the street that the guy pissed in the middle of on the front of the Post yesterday, or needed to use that ATM in the picture I sent. Much different when it's in your face every day. \n\nTaylor: Do you think those people are mentally sound? I would guess those people need a lot of help. \n\nSam: There are definitely two different categories. I just have no sympathy for the large group that refuses to help themselves. And they are everywhere. \n\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nSam: Saw the BAND NAME at Venue last night with _______. Only other time I've seen them was with you at Another Venue. \n\nTaylor: Nice\n\nSam: Off to Italy right now. See you in a couple of weeks?\n\nTaylor: Have fun\n\nSam: Those aren't your normal enthusiastic texts. Why?\n\nTaylor: You wouldn't be asking the question if you didn't have some idea why. Honestly, those things you said really bothered me. I'm sure I'll be over it by the time you get back. I'm just not over it right now. \n\nSam: It's a difference of opinion on a social issue. You've never had that happen before? I've got good friends who think Obama is the equivalent to Satan and born in Kenya. \n\nTaylor: I don't think it's a social issue. I think it's a deeply rooted value. We could disagree all day long on abortion, politics, criminalizing drug use...whatever. But a lack of empathy for fellow humans is way deeper than any of that. And I'm trying not to be brash, I think your Italy trip is well-timed and I can cool off before saying anything stupid\n\nSam: So you think I have no empathy for fellow humans? That's beyond stupid. Where are you getting that from?\n\nTaylor: \"I'm so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever.\"\n\nSam: So you take one half-serious text and accuse me of having no empathy for fellow humans? I then explained my ACTUAL opinions quite thoroughly. You either misread that or need to get off your pedestal. We have the EXACT same level of caring for others. \n\nTaylor: I'm not on any pedestal. But your comments hurled you off the one I had you on. I don't want to fight, I just need time to cool off because if you were joking it was still extremely offensive\n\nSam: So what's more offensive? A simple joke or accusing a friend of lack of character? You tell me. \n\nTaylor: This is why I didn't want to talk about this now \n\nSam: Why not? It's how you feel. And when I said I wasn't opposed to joining you at the shelter (actually like the idea), did you just choose to ignore that part when you were passing judgement on my character? \n\nTaylor: Because I wanted time to cool off. \n\nSam: Haha, cool off from what? We were discussing a social issue like adults do and you turned it into a moral issue. So what's next? I'm pro choice, so I have no empathy for babies? \n\nTaylor: This is why I wanted to take a step back, so I could better discern emotion and logic. Do you REALLY want to have this out right now?\n\nSam: I've already stated my case several times. I'm good as long as you realize how offensive that is to judge someone's entire character like that. Luckily, I have very thick skin.\n\nTaylor: Do you realize it's offensive to call people disgusting without understanding their life situation and where they came from?\n\nSam: What part of \"joke\" did you not get? I've stated my true opinions. If I had known that you couldn't take a joke and were the moral defender of all less fortunate, I wouldn't have joked. You have to admit, to say I have no empathy for fellow humans is a ridiculous statement. \n\nTaylor: Ok. It was a joke. I'll accept it. Have a good trip.\n\n\n", "score": 28, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3dkwxv", "name": "t3_3dkwxv", "created_utc": 1437100625.0, "title": "AMITA for being pissed?", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "Ok, So I live with three others, but only me and one of the guys smoke trees.

There was only one person working the counter when we got there, but no line so we decided to have a couple of samples. While we were, the line grew and my anxiety at holding up the line with it. So we order our ice creams and pay, the total was less than four dollars and I paid with a 20 and received 3 fives. The guy at the counter immediately started helping the next customer so I didn't have the chance to ask him to make change. My coworker didn't have change either but I'm insane about tipping so I couldn't really let that lie. I saw there were a couple of ones in the jar already so figured, hey, $3 is a generous tip, but it makes me feel better than no dollars, so I threw a five in and grabbed the two ones and walked out of the Cold Stone area.\n\nWhat\u2019s this?

I'm possibly moving in 2nd semester with the friend who I texted this to. Us 4 guys had a lot of built up anger about things that have very little to do with this post, so I'll skip most of it. Due to our anger and lack of communication with all of us, we organized a meeting a couple of weeks ago to talk out our issues with each other. \n\nAt this \"meeting\" I told my friend that it's annoying that I can't talk to him when he is constantly texting his girlfriend, because it's in one ear and out the other. Every single time I am with him he is texting his girlfriend, and whatever she has to say is always more important that the people he is with. She's a junior in high school and to me, is very clingy. I wish I could communicate just HOW OFTEN HE TEXTS HER, even when he is with me and the rest of our group. Anyways, at this meeting he agreed with me and promised to stop and that he would live in the moment with his friends, and not constantly be texting her.\n\nI guess that went in one ear and out the other because last night we went to see the movie Southpaw (one of the best movies I've ever seen, might I add) and he was texting her the whole fucking time! Every 5 seconds I would see his screen light up, and he would tap away texting her back. I called him out on it after the movie and he claimed that he only did it during the boring parts. I was especially bothered because I paid for his movie ticket. I always buy for him because he can't afford the things we do, and I can. His constant texting of her, even after we have spoken about it, annoys the shit out of me.\n\nSo today he texted me asking if I wanted to go to dinner tonight. I told him sure. Five minutes later he texted back saying that his girlfriend's parents thought he was going with them tonight, so he told me that he couldn't have dinner tonight, and tried to make it funny. I replied with a \"Fuck you\" and \"You're a dick.\" and he replied with two texts, one saying \"Okay\" and the other saying \"My bad, I'm sorry I thought I wasn't going to.\" Perhaps I was being too hard but it might be part of this built up anger that his girlfriend takes priority over everything that is happening at a given time. Asked him after the movie what he was doing this weekend, he's going to hang out with his girlfriend every night this weekend. It's annoying the shit out of me. He always says \"If it's a real relationship, then it will last.\" And every time I want to reply \"If it's a real relationship, she'll understand when you're hanging out with your friends and neither of you will text each other.\"\n\nAnyways Reddit, Am I the Asshole?", "score": 19, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3eif6j", "name": "t3_3eif6j", "created_utc": 1437785225.0, "title": "I want to go on a family vacation w/out my husband.

Our lease is up in 2 days and his plan was to move out and find a place with his girlfriend. My plan was to move out and find another roommate. Last week he sends me a text saying he's staying another month. This is ok for me since I hadn't nailed down a new roommate or place yet either. \n\nMonday night (2 days ago) I come home from work to find our place chock full of moving boxes and new furniture. His girlfriend, who got evicted from her other place, is suddenly here living his room with the rest of her stuff strewn out throughout the apartment. AND her dog. He didn't tell me because he, \"didn't think I'd care.\"\n\nToday, nearing the end of the month, I wanted to confirm we're splitting the rent 3 ways. They can both afford it; she's actually the one with the job in the relationship (he has GI bill military income each month). He told me there was no way in hell that was happening because she's his guest and not a tenant. I surveyed the massive piles of boxes and gestured but that only set him off further. Anyway, apparently that's the end of the discussion. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n----\n\nUpdate - She just got home and said the same thing he did. Visit to the leasing office first thing tomorrow.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 2, 7/30/15 10:50am\n\nI asked the leasing office to please send me a copy of the contract as they weren't open yet this morning when the stopped by. The lovely lady very quickly accommodated and sent over the fine print. I mucked through the legalese and found these two exciting clauses:\n\n\"**34. PETS:** No pets are permitted without the prior written consent of the Landlord. Any such consent may be revoked at any time, with or without cause, by giving ten (10) days written notice. Except to the extent written permission is given, pets may not be brought upon the Premises, whether such pets belong to Resident(s) or to any other person. **The presence of any pets as to which written permission has not been given and is not currently in force, even if such pets are \"just visiting\", shall be deemed a material and incurable breach of this Lease and shall be cause for the service of a three-day notice terminating the tenancy.** This policy does not apply to service animals.\"\n\n\"**Visitors**\n\nTenant acknowledges that his guests are his responsibility that they will park in only designated parking areas and that they will adhere to all the apartment rules. Visitors are limited to a 5 days day stay. Visitors staying longer than 5 days days must notify Management in writing.\"\n\nCheckmate.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 3, 7/30/15 4:00pm\n\nRoommate obviously noticed the signs of me packing up and asked if I was moving out. I said I had nothing to say to him. I plan on talking to the leasing people tomorrow. He came back an hour later and said, \"Just so you know, if you don't pay August rent I will sue you in Small Claims Court.\"\n\nI told him to have a nice day.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 4, 7/30/15 11:48pm\n\nI have completely moved out. The leasing people, who I talked with for an hour, were *exceedingly* unhelpful. If I ever want to be able to legally move out of there I have to have him co-sign a \"roommate separation agreement\" and he. will. not. sign. it.\n\nThey tell me that I wouldn't even be able to be eligible to get my deposit back until both of us move out. I asked what that meant if he stayed there for 5 years and the woman shrugged at me. They say also that anything that is problematic with the apartment while she's there is my responsibility too because my name is on the lease. \"You're telling me that my roommate brings an uninvited guest and her dog against my wishes, I report it, and I'll get in trouble for having an unauthorized pet?\"\n\n\"Your name is on the lease.\" the woman said and stared blankly.\n\nLater, in an unfortunate fit of rage while loading/packing, her stupid dog walked past me in the hallway while the front door was open because I was carrying things. I yelled, \"GET OUT!\" at it. \n\nLooking worried it ran outside and she chased it. I closed the door and locked it. Not like she has a key. Anyway he threatened to call the cops. I told him go ahead, but he backed down. After talking with my parents they suggested, \"Oh why don't you talk to dear family friend, the attorney who specializes in real estate whose husband is a realtor and they are our neighbors and you practically were an older brother to their daughter?\"\n\n*facepalm because I completely forgot about that wonderful woman* \"Yes, please, dad. Would you please call her and ask if it's ok for me to get her advice?\"\n\nHe sent off a voicemail and an email. Hopefully I will get in touch tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed.\n\n----\n\n**FINAL UPDATE** 8/3/15  6:53pm PST\n\nOn Friday I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the leasing office and CCed the roommate stating I had moved out, new person had moved in with dog, I wish to give notice, he wont let me off lease, etc. I also stated I would be pursuing small claims court action. I did.  Then I went to the local small claims court and submitted California SC-100 form for 3 months rent, my deposit, and an extra $1000 for potential pet damages against the roommate. 3 months is because court dates can take a while and if I wasn't allowed off the lease I would have to be compensated. I had no expectation of getting this money; what I wanted was to be able to walk away free and clear. That was the alternative I planned to present to him.\n\nI received a text on Friday evening from the roommate that I had been released from the lease. I know he had not received the paperwork yet, so this was likely a response to the text I sent him that said, \"hey I need you to pay me $4200\" as required by law (I have to ask for it before taking legal action). The leasing company made it clear I still had to give 30 days notice so today being the 3rd I had to visit the office and pay my half of the $1875 rent so I could walk away. I was prepared for that outcome.\n\nI asked for my copy of the release form he signed and then inquired about the rent I had to pay. Apparently he added his girlfriend and her dog to the lease. She is on the lease. Their names are on the lease. \"Wait,\" I said, \"does this mean I don't have to pay for August?\"\n\nIn true bureaucratic form they answered, \"Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\nI blinked and stared. \"I'm... free?\"\n\n\"Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\n\"Can I get that in writing?\" I inquired, starting to feel a twinge of hope.\n\n\"That's what this release form is. It was signed on the 31st. You claim to have moved out. Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\n\"Would you like my keys?\" I asked\n\n\"We can take them or you can give them to your old roommate.\"\n\n\"Thanks I'd like to never see him again. Here is the door key and here is the postal box key. You have been wonderful. Goodbye\"\n\nThen I left. I am now on my 3rd beer and happy as a clam. I will call off the lawsuit ASAP.

I was going to quit, but we are so understaffed that the GM wanted me to stay, until a replacement was found. The deal (which was made by the GM), was that I would need to stay working there, until a replacement was found, and in return, I would get a third day off and a raise of 35 cents. For four weeks straight I got the third day off, but not the fifth/last week I'd work there. That fifth week was a day that we would have an inspection done by the owner of the restaurant and a couple other people. Without telling me that I would need to work an extra day that week, the GM puts me to work for five days. This wouldn't have been a problem, if it was the first time this happened. When I saw the schedule on Monday, it was still being reworked, but I did see my name and the times I would work. I thought that he was working on it, so I didn't really think much of it. The next day I worked, I noticed that he hadn't changed a single thing from what I had seen the day before. I thought that it was odd, that he would do this, since it was a deal that he made the conditions for. The whole time I worked that day, I couldn't stop thinking about the reason he could have gone back on the deal, without telling me. I assumed it was because of the Inspection we were having. This eased my mind until I remembered that I had done a deal with him before, that he went back on, after the fourth week. This knowledge made me think hard of the last time. I started to think of the pattern that these two shared. Four weeks of him going through with the deal, not getting it the fifth week, getting it again on the sixth week, and then never getting it again after that. This realization made me believe that it was going to happen again. I didn't want it to, so after a day of talking about it with my family, I decided that I would quit at the end of the week. The next time I worked, I told every co-worker that I was going to leave at the end of the week and why I was doing it. (I wanted to have a nice goodbye between me and the other workers that I enjoyed working with.) I also asked them to do me the favor of not telling the GM I was leaving till my last day. I did this since I didn't believe that the GM deserved a heads up about me quitting, since he went back on the deal. I did this until my last day. On the morning of my last day, I came to work with a type of cake that I would bring whenever it was someone's last day of work. When he saw this cake, he knew something was up. He asks me about the cake, and I respond by saying that it was my last day. He gets surprised and wants to know why. I explain my reasonings and end it with saying that I didn't want to work for someone who would keep going back on deals after the fourth week. He protested by saying that he thought that I would understand. I did understand, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. \n\n\nThis small section is about me actually being an asshole. Throughout my last day working there, any time the GM would mention him being able to make deals with people and being able to follow through, I would go very out of my way to mention that he could not follow through after the fourth week. It didn't matter if he was talking with an employee, customer, or one of his friends, I would mention this.\n\n\ntl:dr   GM makes a deal with me so I don't quit, then goes back on said deal one month later. \n\n\nEdit: I just realized how much I typed.", "score": 15, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3fa9u3", "name": "t3_3fa9u3", "created_utc": 1438347417.0, "title": "Planning to cheat with a girl...", "link_flair_text": "/r/relationships", "selftext": "So, me and my friends tend to chill every week or so.

You are holding a lot of resentment towards this woman because you have been overburdened with work. It sounds like your company is to blame for most of the problems that are going on. \n\nFirst off, how does she have that much sick time and vacation time? If she has the time she is free to take it whenever the company allows her too. That isn't fair to you or your other coworkers, but the truth is that people are going to spend their time as they see fit. If your managers are allowing her to schedule her vacation time before you every time then this is a problem. They have to give you some consideration. Also, if you are on vacation and she calls out sick then that is not your problem (or it shouldn't be your problem). The managers are the ones who should be stepping in and picking up the slack. I would not come in on my scheduled vacation without being compensated. If it were a one time thing or some big crisis at work, then I could see it, otherwise I wouldn't be giving up that time. If there is only the two of you (since the other person is no longer working there) then the company needs to get another person to help you because this woman is unreliable. If they don't want to pay for an extra person they should be firing her. There isn't much you can do about that.\n\nAnother big issue is that your managers have fostered an adversarial working environment. If it is a project you are working on together it shouldn't make a big different about who is assigned what or given credit for work. You can't work on a project and be successful because you are both hell bent on getting more recognition than the other. The truth is you need to be working as a team and let that show through in the final product. \n\nYour managers aren't delegating tasks. If you were both assigned certain tasks it would make things easier. That way you would get credit for what you did and she would get credit for what she did. That would make it so she didn't feel like she needed to horde all the work. Your managers shouldn't be allowing that to begin with. You should both have access to the information you need for the project. I understand that can be difficult to implement sometimes, but it would really help everyone involved.\n\nIt was a bit aggressive to call her out. If the project that the two of you are working on it shouldn't matter who conveys the idea as long as it gets put out there. As a team they should assume you have worked on things together. This woman sounds annoying, but you managers are not doing their jobs.\n\nIt sounds like you need to sit down with your manger and talk about how you are feeling. Don't throw your other coworker under the bus. I would even consider writing down what you are feeling in a letter to get your thoughts out and organized before you go to see your manager. Don't point fingers and make broad accusations. Explain that it has been difficult to get thing done because it has somehow ended up a competition. I am guessing you guys are paid by the hour instead of a salary based on the fact they wanted you to take unpaid time off because they weren't didn't want to pay you if they didn't have to (even though they are paying for some who is wasting their time). Explain that you are worried it has become competitive and that you need the ability to access to group information. Let your manager know that it would be saving time and getting projects done quicker if you could work on whatever hasn't been done. \n\nDo you best to frame it in a positive way. Make it clear that you are looking for a bitter way to complete projects. You want to be efficient and it is difficult because you are not getting the information you need. Let him know you are happy to work on finding a system that works  for everyone involved. You need to be able to take your vacation time (unless they would like to pay you for every vacation day you don't take (If you have a paid vacation days they are supposed to pay you for what you don't use. I will admit I don't know exactly how it works, but I know if my husband were to quit he would have to pay him for his time)/ Make it very clear that while you take your job seriously and don't mind being a team player, you have a problem with your coworker getting to use up her time first and expecting you to cover for her every single time she calls out sick. You can't drop all your plans at the last minute because of that she isn't doing your job. If a real emergency you are willing to help, but the frequency in which they call you for this reason is becoming a real problem. Be direct, but polite. \n\nYou may want to consider looking for another job. I understand it is difficult to find a job, especially the way things are today, but this sounds like a toxic place to work. You shouldn't have to fight for anything\n\nSorry if my post is a bit inconsistent. I took my medication that helps me sleep and it kicked in sooner than I thought. I have been falling asleep as I sit up and type this. Best of luck. I'm sorry you are  dealing with this.\n\ntl;dr: calling her out was rude and unprofessional, but it sounds like bigger issues here that have allowed to fester.

First off there's the main girl we'll call her M (I will also refer to M and \"her\") then there is the guy we'll call him D(I will also refer to D as \"him\"), there is another girl that I had a thing with we'll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we'll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.\n\nIn the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.\n\nLong story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren't really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. \n\nIn the middle of summer M and D hadn't gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn't really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn't want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren't dating and that she didn't like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this \"date\" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren't officially \"dating\" but they have a \"thing\" whatever that means. \n\nThe next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn't fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we're very similar, I don't know him to well), my one con was that I wasn't in her friend group and D's one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.\n\nMoving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn't really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can't face anything coming towards her (I'm assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn't think he capable of just listening. She went on and said \"And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that's actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can't because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn't. And I hate that. I really don't like it. But it's there. And I don't know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it's not fair to either of you.\" Honestly, I don't know what to take from this part of the text, but now you're caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.\n\nTLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.\n", "score": 2, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3gkxtq", "name": "t3_3gkxtq", "created_utc": 1439292855.0, "title": "[META] Another AmItheAsshole segment on Painkiller Already - Time stamp: 1:20:13", "link_flair_text": "META", "selftext": "", "score": 47, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3gl6fn", "name": "t3_3gl6fn", "created_utc": 1439298049.0, "title": "Am I an asshole for constantly lying to my mother?", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "so i basically signed up for the marching band. i really liked it at first then it just became shitty. and speaking of shitty that is the excuse i use every time i don't want to go. it really sucks i have to lie to my mom but she just wont let me quit.

I was working the tills, which in my shop is a long desk with three tills on it. The space behind it isn't particularly big, about 1.2m (4ft) wide at a guess. This gets used for returned items, as a holding area for big/bulky/heavy stuff customers want (saves them carrying it round) and so on. It is my job at the end of the day to ensure this area is as clear as possible (particularly for health and safety reasons). \n\n**Person 1**\n\nI'll call him N. He was working the main floor section and started at the same time as I did. Now we have an internal phone system where each section has its own phone, along with the duty manager. I came on, gave both him and me time to get ourselves going, and then gave his phone a call to let him know he had stock to go back out. He told me he'd get it as soon as he'd done some pricing, which is fair enough. This was about 4.30pm. \n\nSkip forward to 5.30pm and I hadn't even seen N around. I gave him another call and reminded him about the stock. He told me he'd be down 'shortly'. I also did the same at 6pm as it was pretty much dead by this point but I couldn't go off my till to do them as I was by myself. \n\n8.30 comes and still this stock was stuck behind my till. Now at this point G was sat at the end of my till doing paperwork, and I asked him if he'd seen N. Now G isn't a team leader or manager, he is the same rank as I am. But when HE called N to do the job I'd been asking him for almost all of the evening, magically he appeared within 20s and did it all. I was sorely annoyed that such a simple job had taken so long, but also that N seemed to think G was more worthy of being listened to. \n\n**Person 2** \n\n  I'll call this person Y. Y was a member of our stock team, but also works a till. If I need extra till staff then I do a tannoy asking for someone to come, and in this case I believed that Y was my first call (you shout ordinary staff first, then a team leader if necessary/no-one else is available, then a manager). This happened late on in my shift, at around 8.15 when we got a small rush of people which left me a little overwhelmed. \n\n  A little earlier, Y had come down and was sat at the end of the desk on the computer which we have, doing something. He'd told me he was 'doing lock-up' and that he was 'supposed to have finished but [manager] told me I could stay'. \n\nThis queue built up, and rather than mucking about with a tannoy for till help I thought to ask Y as I knew he could work the till. He could quite clearly see I was in need of the help, but claimed he 'couldn't' go on the till because he was supposed to be finished. \n\n Now my logic is that if a staff member is on the shop floor, it is a reasonable expectation that they are actually actively working. But what particularly angered me was that this whole thing happened infront of customers, and it served to make me look (or at least feel) pretty bad when a staff member in uniform was there and not actually helping. \n\nSo, who was the asshole in these two situations?

Still, I drove them up to her place and she found places in the garden for the succulents and places in the house for the air plants.\n\nShe by no means has a black thumb- she has many succulents herself and even has two air plants of her own she managed to keep alive for over a year now.  Still, she made me swear that I wouldn't be mad at her if some of my plants died.  I put aside five of the air plants and told her that these were my special plants and I would appreciate it if she could take extra special care of them.  I also told her about one of my succulents which is a rare crested variety and a prized possession.  She seemed to be paying attention.  I assured her there were NO SPECIAL WATERING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF MY PLANTS.  In fact, she even has written instructions on the best method for watering all air plants, put together by me.  It's super easy.  I told her to water my air plants when she did hers and same for the succulents.\n\nMost of my air plants are in handcrafted terrariums.  She was worried that she wouldn't be able to remember which plant went in which terrarium, so I just told her to take them all out and leave them on a towel by a window to get partial sun.  I told her I would put them all back when I had a chance to get them from her.\n\nApparently, that was too complicated for her, because a week later she tells me she's going to try to sell some, with my blessing.  I am uncomfortable, but tell her OK as long as it's not the five I've set aside.  Then I get another blow when she tells me she sold a piece for $10.  I told her that the materials alone costed closer to $40, but she said she just wanted to make space.  I know she's weird about clutter, so I let it slide.\n\nI didn't hear anything from her for about two months on this subject.  Then, last weekend, I asked for pictures of some of my plants because I missed them (and I knew they were getting a bit more sun, so I was excited to see how well they were growing!).  She doesn\u2019t send the pics for like three days.  When she does, I am extremely disappointed.  It is clear she has not watered a single plant in two months.  My rare crested succulent is fried to a crisp, which is incredibly heartbreaking (as it is kind of irreplaceable), and the other plants I\u2019ve nurtured for over two years are dead and dying.\n\nShe tells me she\u2019s going to water the air plants the next day.  I know for a fact that this is the first time she\u2019s watered them in two months, goaded by my request for photos (she even asked me if my requesting photos \u201cwas a test\u201d).  Of course, she reports back that a lot of them are dead.  Not only the ones that I was a little less attached to, but the five I selected because I had an emotional attachment to them.  One of those five is called tillandsia tectorum, and was easily a $30 specimen.\n\nNeedless to say I am beside myself right now.  I can\u2019t even bring myself to talk to her, and I usually talk to her every day.  It\u2019s not like she\u2019s busy, she doesn\u2019t have a job and me and my brother have been out of the house for years.  I honestly have no clue what she does on a daily basis.\n\nSo, what do you think, Reddit? AITA for asking such a big favor of her? Should I have expected it? AITA for being mad at her?  How can I talk about this with her?  No matter how I tell her I\u2019m upset, all she\u2019ll do is focus on the fact she was doing me a huge favor and how I should be grateful.  At this point in my life I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s her being narcissistic as usual, or me being selfish and rude.

A school bus pulled up and a group of very rowdy students and adults from a local recreation center got off and began to play in the field.  One of the teachers brought a student over to the picnic tables.  Instead of sitting the child at any of the 11 unoccupied picnic tables in the immediate area, she sat him at the one that I was using.  Keep in mind, I had been the only one there.  All of the other tables were available.\n\n\"I'd actually prefer to eat privately,\" I said to the teacher.\n\n\"No, you're fine,\" was her reply.  \n\nSince she obviously wasn't going to move the child to any of the vacant picnic tables, I packed up my lunch.  As I was going, I said to the teachers, \"There were all these open tables.  This is pretty rude.\"  \n\nTheir collective response was that this is a public park and I don't own the picnic tables.  I agreed with them, but I persisted that they chose to use the one table where someone was quietly minding his own business.  This is like going into a movie theater where only one person is sitting in the middle of the theater and deciding to take the seat smack dab next to them.  Or getting on a bus where there are loads of open seats but deciding to take the seat right next to someone.  They are crowding someone when there is an obvious alternative.\n\nBut besides being invasive to me, it's also questionable judgement to decide that the best place to seat a child is next to the random stranger at the park.  Good thing I'm not some sicko.  Also, I think if the situation had been reversed, if the kids had been at the table first and I had just wandered by and sat down with them, the teachers would obviously be perturbed.  \n\nSo what do you think?  The teachers all reacted as if I was being really unreasonable.  With eleven open tables and only one occupied, I think it's just plain rude to choose the one that's occupied.  Yes, it's a public park.  Yes, you have the right to seat the child at the table.  No, I don't own the table.  But all that being said, to choose my table seemed like an obviously rude thing to do.  You can have the right to do something and that thing can still be a rude thing to do.  \n\nWas I an asshole?

Basically, I'm living with a roommate for the next few months although I'd much rather live alone. If you don't want to know the details, just skip the next part:\n\n> Six years ago, I moved into this flat with two roommates and back then, I loved it. We got to know each other quite well, and after a while one of my roomies became my girlfriend. The other roommate moved to a different city but also kept her old room, so she could come over from time to time to visit her old friends. Basically, it was just me and my gf most of the time and I got used to that. I didn't want to share my personal space with anyone else anymore.\n> \n> But A few months ago, my gf confessed that she had an affair, I broke up and kicked her out. So then her room was empty and I couldn't afford the rent alone. Finding a new (cheap) place to live is a nightmare in my city. In a few months, I will probably start a new job that will require me to move anyway so I decided it was the best to get a (temporary) roommate.\n\nNow, when I was showing the flat to my future roommates, I made it pretty clear that personal space and general quietness are very important to me. My now-roomie said it's the same for him and he doesn't mind. I believed him, so he got the room.\n\nHe's a really nice guy and he is absolutely quiet, only invites his gf or 1-2 other friends over, doesn't have any big parties, doesn't listen to loud music, doesn't just burst into my room...\n\nBut he likes talking to me.

However the situation, however muted has been a powder keg of an issue that could blow up if somebody comes across just the wrong way. \n\nAnyway;\n\nThe first and largest issue starts off with my friends; a married couple, and a mutual friend of ours. We'll call the married couple X and Y, the mutual friend We'll call Z.\n\nAnyways, Z and I had gotten into this table to game that was relatively new, and found a local game store that was going to start running events for it, enter X and Y. Over the following year we all become rather great friends and a wonderful group to just chill with if not just to play a game. \n\nEventually it became open knowledge Z was in an 'Open' relationship with his SO, and that he was actively looking.\nX had confronted Z and asked him \"as a friend\" (note this for later) not to involve Y in his search. a reasonable request.\n\nFast forward to New Years. This is that part that I prefaced about where I don't know (or really want to know) the whole story. all I know is that Z overstepped his bounds, violating X's request. So much so that it caused significant issue between X and Y (They're stable, but I'm to believe they've not come to terms yet).\n\nthere was a period of time when they closed up shop for several months, and didn't invite or really speak to anybody while they sorted stuff out between themselves. I'm unsure how much they've confronted Z about it, but I don't know if they have due to the personal conflict. Perhaps they swept it under the rug to save face. either way, eventually things got back to 'normal'\n\nfast forward to a new expansion that had been out for the game we all played for a bit. X had more or less found a rather potent combo that would later become a strong competitive play. Z, who at this point became the organizer for tournaments and such for said game at the LGS (Local Game Store).\n\nSeeing the combo executed in full strength made Z upset, feeling that it was unbalanced and wanted to have input brought in from the game's higher-ups. Z had went to X, and asked him \"As a friend\" to not play that combo during the next tournament, as he cannot outright tell somebody not to play anything, unless rules say otherwise. This made X pretty upset, and ran it anyway. Lo and behold, Z has issue with it. but like my wonderful friends to, instead of talking it out, they continue to just walk away from the issue and let the pot boil.\n\nfast forward about 6-7 months or so, and we're doing the initial stuff for store championships at a different LGS. Z was getting flustered, as X happened to have a gameplay strategy that was able to overtake Z's. (Z isn't running this event, as a side note) Losing sucks, and people get hot headed and flustered, so this wasn't unusual. X however took it a little to personally, when Z was making statements on him building something to directly counter him. \n\nThis was the straw that broke the camel's back, however. Most of us (X, Y, Myself, and a separate other concerned friend who opted to play mediator for Z) decided we needed to organize an intervention for Z's attitude, as from one side of the argument, he was having an attitude problem with alot of us. (He had been having job issues, and other personal conflicts, and stress buildups.) We decided to get with Z first and get more info. It was miscommunicated on what X was going to do, but what winds up happening was X renounces his friendship with Z, in an attempt to just remove ill-will from X's life just by removing him as a friend. \n\nThat's pretty much the bulk of it, Eventually Y does the same, as she tries to talk with Z and he seems to not want to listen to anything. \n\nI'm still friends with both parties, and while X & Y seem OK now, Z still has issues. He feels like he can't show up at the LGS sometimes in fear that X is there. (Which to me, is just fucking stupid. but that's just because i think the whole thing is stupid, minus the first issue which i believe is the core of the problem).\n\nI think it seems pretty clear who the asshole is. but i feel like I may still be missing several important details, and I can't ask Z about said details as I don't want to stir the shitstorm back up, and I'm on my word that I wouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n(Posting this from an alt, even so as not to be stumbled across.)\n\nI'm unsure how to proceed, but these issues have basically killed the playgroup, and the game for our LGS, and I can't seem to organize any decent hangout time, as X & Y got out of the game, and are doing other things. Z still runs the game at said LGS, but I have to keep in a decent topic otherwise he'll get a near anxiety attack just thinking about the bullshit issues. Alot of this will probably read extremely trivial and one sided, and from an outside source, it basically is. there's some things I've left out as they're complicated to explain, and aren't exactly of importance\n\nI just wanna get my friends back to normal but I don't think it'll happen especially since none of them apparently know how to talk or listen to each other.\n\nWho's the asshole here? X/Y for not being forthcoming with their feelings? Z for completely burning X and Y's trust? Or perhaps I missed a cue in stopping the whole thing?

She could not maneuver her scooter around our table. She then pointed her cup at me and in a very rude manner demanded I fill her cup up. \"I can't get over there so fill this up,\" is exactly what she told me! I scoffed at her and said something on the lines of \"get up and fill it yourself!\" At this time my father, being the outstanding person he is, grabs her cup and fills it up for her. She leaves and my father tells me how that was uncalled for and that he raised me better than that. I explained to him that she was not even handicapped!

The other day we were playing Rocket League with two of my longer-term friends, and he, to me, didn't look or sound bored of it despite not really knowing the two others. Then suddenly his girlfriend calls him on skype in the middle of the match. He stops moving, tabs out, disconnects from TeamSpeak and starts talking to her.\n\nIn Rocket League he'll also stop driving, look at and reply to a snap, and then start driving again. \n\nHe's done this a number of times during different game sessions, and it's starting to piss me off. \n\nYesterday we played Factorio. During a downtime in the production, I whipped out my electric guitar and started playing. I did not plug it in, and there was nothing to do in-game. He got visibly and audibly irritated at that, and normally he doesn't have anything against me playing. I put it away after just a couple of picture, because he obviously didn't like me playing at that time. Not even 30  minutes later his girlfriend calls and he starts talking to her exclusively, with me being second in line.\n\nAm I the asshole for not just accepting him being in love, which I feel like I do already? Should I just suck it up because \"that's just how it is\"?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSomething else that's been pissing me off about it is that when they talk they'll have two conversations going at the same time. One over snapchat/steam, and one on skype. Sometimes it's painstakingly obvious that something is \"going on\", that they don't want me to hear/see. He'll angle the phone away from me when recieving a snap, go to the bathroom and then emerge two minutes later. And then do it again five minutes later. I just feel like that is something that should be reserved for when I'm not around. Like every single tuesday and every other weekend.

Now my girlfriend and I argue quite a lot and a few months back during an argument she made a personal attack on me and I in turn made a personal attack on her. My girlfriend then turned around and slapped me twice; saying her actions were justified because of what I said. I did not slap her back and simply told her to get out of my room. \n\nNow recently we had another argument which was much worse and in this argument I realised where this was going and repeatedly told my girlfriend to leave my room so we could cool down. She refused. \n\nEvery single time I tried to make her leave she would scream 'Don't touch me!' Don't touch me!!' \n\nSo I went into my bed, under the covers and stopped replying to her in an attempt to cool down, she did not like the fact that I wasn't arguing back with her and thus she in turn poured bottle of water all over my bed covers so that the water seeped through. I then got pissed and tried to snatch the bottle of water away from her to pour it on her and in the process of the struggle she pulled the bottle away really fast and hit her thumb against a wall which turns out ended up breaking her thumb (we didn't know this at the time). \n\nAfter this I repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused.\n\nI then locked myself in the bathroom and told her I was going to call security; it was at that moment she began to scream saying 'Don't fucking call security!' whilst trying to force open the bathroom door, I didn't want to create drama in my uni halls in front of my room mates (who I didn't really know well) so I held off from calling security (bad decision I know).  \n\nOnce it seemed she calmed down I came out the bathroom and the arguing continued. Once again after we verbally insulted each other my girlfriend then slapped me again, at the point I was beginning to lose it but I didn't slap her back. I tried to restrain her and in the process she began trying choke me, I then threw her into the bed to get her away from me.\n\nShe got back up and tried to push me again but was unsuccessful. Fast forwarding after more arguing we finally calmed down slightly and there was a silent pause, I then kneeled down to put my charger into a socket and out of no where my girlfriend just pushed me hard and I got knocked into a chair. \n\nAt this point. I fucking lose it. \n\nI get up, I grab my girlfriend and push her so hard that she goes flying backwards at least 3-4 yards and smashes her back into my door. BANG. \n\nAll of sudden she lets off a shriek of pain. Real fucking loud. \n\nRemember my neighbors who I mentioned earlier that I don't really know? They hear the screaming and at least 4 guys show up outside my door hearing her screaming 'You pushed me! You pushed me!'. \n\nThey in turn say \"Don't worry we're outside, if he's treating you badly we're here and we've already called security!.\" She then tells these guys who are outside my door to get ALL of her friends that live upstairs with her, within 3 minutes I have at least 20 people outside of my door thinking I've just beat my girlfriend up. \n\nSecurity arrive and ask me to open the door; I do so and immediately 3 security guards come inside and begin asking what's happened. My girlfriend makes up a story about how she fell despite the fact that she just told the guys outside something entirely different. \n\nAs if this couldn't get any worse about 5 minutes later I receive another knock at the door ordering me to open the door. It's the police. \n\nOne of the students had called police and upon opening the door these two massive officers walk in. One immediately asks me to leave the room and come outside with him; I do so and as I walk into the corridor I see the looks of all these people I that had once liked me look at me with disgust; no one says anything to me. \n\nI'm questioned and let go and according to my girlfriend the police had asked her if she wanted to press charges; she declined.\n\nI walked back and I saw everyone from my floor, everyone from her floor, all our mutual friends as well as her close friends from back home who were visiting outside my room once again giving me the most disgusted look thinking I had just beaten her up. \n\nNeedless to say I lost all my friends that day and no one cared to even ask me about my side of the story. \n\nAt university I now have no friends, and will have to live off campus by myself which means making new friends will be incredibly difficult, it's not helped by the fact that I'm really introverted. I'm also terrified of the prospect of even going out to freshers week as there is only one club at my university and I won't have anyone to go with and anyone that I do bump into from last year will make it really awkward. \n\nThis literally keeps me up at night, so tell me, was I an ass hole? \n\nEdit* - I've realised that me and my girlfriend can no longer be together.\n\nEdit edit* - I just realised PKA is being recorded tonight, perhaps this will be featured on the show.

As far as I'm concerned, sexual health and satisfaction are important and therefore require the use of specialized tools such as dildos, vibrators, porn, whips, etc. I don't think she has any right to try to discourage me from behaving the same way she does.\n\nThe only reason why I think I could even possibly be the asshole in this situation is because early in our marriage when I found out she was using sex toys for masturbating I felt some trepidation. She told me that despite the size difference between my penis and her dildos ( I'm smaller ) sex was still great. She also explained to me that she needed to have her clitoris stimulated during intercourse in order to orgasm consistently. I was able to exercise the anxiety I felt about toys over the course of a few months once we started using vibrators during sex. I understand that she might need some time to get used to this idea but I don't think I should be punished with a no sex policy in the meantime. Especially since she is still using dildos.

I'm making this because I'm not really that sure if he is one or not, but I will be making this from my point of view]\n\nContext: My Theology teacher (male, approx 35) was supposed to go to a doctors appointment, but the sub was unable to fill in, so he probably became pissed that day. I am a male senior in highschool probably pissed him off.\n\nIn Theology class, my teacher (I'll call him Mr. Johnson) asked the class who has their homework from his desk. I said that I did, since I was close to him, I decided to try to hand it to him. Unfortunately, the distance between me and him was about a yard, so I tossed it onto his desk. He caught it and then ripped the paper and saying, \"You don't throw things to me.\" in a stern voice and then threw the shreds in the recycling bin.\n\nI decided that I would pick up what's left of my homework after class. About 5 minutes after Mr. Johnson ripped up my homework, another teacher (I'll call her Ms. Robertson) came into class asking for the recycling bin, so I was unable to take back my homework, tape it back together, and attempt to try to return it in. Because Ms. Robertson \"just happened\" to come into the class asking for the recycling bin, I'm very positive that Mr. Johnson did this, since he already knew that Ms. Robertson will come in for the bin.\n\nLater on in class, one of my classmates (I'll call him Sean) turned around and told me that two years ago, Mr. Johnson burned his notes in class. It turns out that, at the time, Mr. Johnson told Sean to not take notes, so Mr. Johnson put Sean's notes into a bowl and lit them on fire. After hearing this, Mr. Johnson's behavior is not that abnormal to my situation.\n\nCoincidentally, the topic of Plato's interpretation of 'what is evil?' came. Accoriding to Plato, there is not such thing as not good and that evil is just not accepting good. In a way, Mr. Johnson tearing my paper can be seen as him teaching me a lesson on respect/his untold class rules. After school, I asked him if I could make up the homework. He said not to worry about it and that he will accept it. Basically, this entire situation was an extremely harsh 'slap on the wrist' scare tactic punishment from my teacher.\n\nSo, what I'm trying to ask is, is Mr. Johnson an asshole for over reacting, or do I deserve what happened because of my disrepect?\n\nTL;DR: Teacher, probably pissed because sub no-showed, ripped up my homework because I tossed it to him when he was a couple of inches away. He saw that as disrepect, and decided to teach me a lesson about respect, but he ended up taking the homework in the end.", "score": 24, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3hwx0a", "name": "t3_3hwx0a", "created_utc": 1440202197.0, "title": "AITA for leaving the stall door open while I took a piss", "link_flair_text": "not the asshole", "selftext": "While at a Minor League baseball game walking back to my seat in the 7th inning, I stopped at the bathroom there was only one urinal open and I didn't want to piss next to two other guys.

This all started around June this summer, so two months ago.\n\nI met this girl - lets call her Jane - at a party and we hit it off kind of. We flirted, and I got her number and we had a kind of thing for a little bit. Well a few weeks later she says we should just be friends, which I'm ok with, despite still liking her. \n\nFast forward to July, near the end of the month I make-out with C. (? Jane? )It was my first kiss and it was great. We then hung-out the next day and I went to kiss her again but she said no and that was that - we decided to be just friends. She really liked my friend Joe, but he wasn't interested, despite her best efforts. She decides to try get over him (win him over?), and since this can be hard, I decide to help.\n\nI ask my friend Joe, to see if he would like to go on a double date with Jane, another girl, and myself. So he agrees and we go on the double date. My date had a 10 p.m. curfew that night so from 10 to 12 I was 3rd wheeling to Jane and Joe. I had too much tea, and turned into a caffiend, jumping around and acting the clown. Every now and again I'd take off for five minutes, to give them a chance to kiss, but he did not kiss her. After giving them ten chances, I was done, and dropped him home, and presumably Jane as well. They swapped numbers. \n\nI talked to Jane about the date, and she was mad that he didn't kiss her. I said maybe he will next time. Due to her volleyball games, she was out of town next weekend, so the next date was 2 weeks later. In the mean time, we discovered we had class near each other, and started hanging out more often. Her best friend was not being a best friend, so I tried to be a good friend, and she offered to set me up with a hot volleyball player. I still liked her a lot, but was fine with her going out with Joe, except that he barely texted her. He would only really text her when I would ask him how it was going with her. Since Jane and I texted a lot, I already knew. He would then text her for about ten minutes, and then stop. \n\nThis upset Jane, and she would complain. Last Saturday evening, we went on the second double date, but she was starting to lose interest, despite my best efforts to make them work. We often talk on the phone to rant about stuff, and on Tuesday night she told me she liked me, not him. Since I still like her, I really want to be with her - she makes me happy, and I feel great around her. So I told her she would have to break up with Joe before I could consider it. Wednesday night, she told him she just wanted to be friends, and they were over. I was unsure how much he liked her, since they went on one date and barely talked. That same night, she told me she wanted to be my girlfriend and I said yes. I'm often moody and sad, but she makes me happy. \n\nI tell Joe, so that he can hear it from me that she likes me, and he gets super mad at me, believing I was trying this entire time to steal her. He does not listen to my explanation, and spreads rumours about it to our mutual friends at school. \n\nNow I have a girlfriend who is out of town, some friends who support me, people who hate me, and I feel really shitty. I tried my best to do the right thing and to help Joe find a new girl, but he won't have any of it. I do not like having enemies, and feel really depressed about it all.

I'm not sure if I'm the asshole because I'm too judgmental, or because I'm enabling someone who's done something I consider despicable, or neither.  I'll try to TL;DR each paragraph.   \n\nTl;DR 1: **As an individual, I am pro life.**  I know it's a pipe dream, but it's my personal hope that not a single other abortion ever happens again in human history (and that includes the equally ridiculous underlying hope that there are no more rapes or cases of incest that cause unwanted pregnancy, etc. etc.).  Just to complicate matters, if I were in government, I would have to vote pro-choice, because I cannot possibly convince myself that the government should claim the right to force a person to go through the medical and emotional ordeal of carrying an unwanted child, under any circumstance. \n\nTL:DR 2: **One of my very best friends had a completely elective abortion, and I have only been supportive, and only expressed concern for the possible emotional impact on her.**  She was living with the guy for years when this happened.  She was finished school and employed. As was he. There were no medical problems.  There were no relationship problems.  There was no sexual assault.  She married him a year later, and now they \"want kids\".  She just said the time wasn't right.  I assume all this info is true, because she was never showing, and didn't need to tell me anything about the pregnancy but told me the story anyway.  \n\nTL:DR 3: **I am constantly silently ashamed of the fact that I have never breathed a word of disapproval to her over this.**  I really don't know what I think I should do, but I know that if I had a friend and I saw him stab a stranger to death in the street and he somehow was found innocent at trial, I would ostracize him.  I would no longer count him as a friend or associate with him if I could help it.  I would have to do something to say that that shit isn't cool, and I have no interest in associating with someone capable of that.  In my mind, abortion without extreme extenuating circumstances is an order of magnitude more heinous act; the victim is infinitely more innocent and defenseless, and the killer is infinitely more directly responsible for that victim's protection.  It's just not a crime the law can punish. \n\nSo, assholery judges...is it fucked up that I basically let it slide?  Is it fucked up that I even think I shouldn't?

I wanted to get rid of them ASAP, selling them for way cheaper then the other users. I see people selling this particular Math text in the range for 100-150$, \"fuck it\" I say to myself, and put it up for 60$ flat. *Ding* I get a message by a girl, saying that she doesn't have a lot of money and would 40$ be enough.

When I was a sophomore and Jacob was a junior, we started to become best friends. We were both middle of the pack in the social hierachy, like we were friends with everyone but we never really had someone to hangout with everyday until we became friends. We are both Mormon and love sports, and we are both average looking guys. Except, I dont know, Jacob, he's kinda goofy looking to be honest. He has really curly hair and braces, and coming from his best friend I'd have to say that if I were a girl I would call him cute at best.\n\nWe both talk to lots of girls, but we never really end up doing much with them in form of a relationship or anything like that. We never really got that close with girls.\n\nFast forward 2 years. I'm getting ready for my senior year, and Jacob is about to leave for his 2 year church mission in a few months. Right after Jacob graduated, his family moved down to a city 30 minutes from my house. (Before that I also lived 30 minutes away. He lived next to the school and I lived pretty far out, now he just lives south of me instead of north.) In the beginning of the summer, we hung out a good amount. Then Jacob made new friends at his church branch in the new city. The Mormons at our old school were the weird, not very attractive girls, very strict kinda religious nuts. Jacob said that at his new church branch everyone was much cooler, and the girls are a lot prettier. He said there was this one called Alyssa, and I'll be honest with you, he sent me a pic of her and she is a solid 9. Of course, I was ecstatic that my best bro is hanging out with such a beautiful girl.\n\nFast forward to August, the end of the summer. Me and Jacob have only hung out once for only a few hours. Apparently things have gotten pretty serious with Alyssa. They talk everyday, they hangout almost every day, they go on dates, etc. Remember this is my boy Jacob, one of the goofiest kids I've ever known and things are getting serious with a very pretty girl. Me and my other good friends try to get Jacob to hang out with us all the time. Usually he can't because he already has plans with Alyssa. At first it was understandable, but after a while it got to be kind of a joke. It seemed like he clearly did not want to hang with his bros. We used to be the biggest proponents of \"bros before hoes\". We vowed this summer to go on a mancave binge, playing our favorite videogame NBA2K, our favorite movies, etc... But it never happened. He was always hanging with Alyssa. When me and my friends would complain to him, he would say, \"No guys, this girl is different. This is for real.\" And that would make me really upset because he is leaving for a mission in October! Why does he wanna hangout so much with this girl when he's gonna leave soon for two years to possibly across the world and have very limmited contact with people at home?\nSo Jacob mentioned he was going to a high school football game in the new city, and he mentioned that he was going with Alyssa's family. (Alyssa is currently out of town visiting a friend, but her family is still here.) So I guess things are serious enough to where he hangs out with her family when she isn't even around. So then I texted Jacob this\n\nBefore you read it, just so you know, Madi is a girl I've always had the biggest crush on.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/7VPlfe2\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9jv0vDO\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cpdFrYb\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WkkKe1S\n\nI've always been the nice guy. I'm never this rude to anyone, especially never my best friend. But I'm tired of it. Always ignoring me and always hanging out with his new girl, I've been fed up. I wanna get the chance to hang with Jacob while I can, before he leaves for two years.\nSo Reddit, that's my story. Am I the asshole?

I payed \u00a330 for it and brought it home. Within a day my mother smelled the substance and told me that I wasn't allowed to have it in her house because it's illegal. Fair enough. I took it out to the shed and put it there on her recommendation. A little while later whilst they were on holiday I took it down to a nearby city and smoked most of it with some friends who I met there.\n\nThis was whilst my family were on holiday.\n\nI came back and since I still had a little bit left I left it in my back and forgot about it. Sure enough, the morning after they came back my mother smelled it again. She asked if I still had the weed and without thinking I said no.\n\nA few days later I was searching through my bag and came across it. Rather than waiting for them to leave and putting it in the shed, I admitted that I had it and went to put it in the shed. She went ballistic.\n\nI was told about how disgusting it was that I was smoking it and how horrible I was for bringing it into her house again. I was threatened to have the police called on me all as I tried to defend myself by asking:\n\n\"How is having pot in the house going to affect anybody negatively. The fact that you've got a little bit of pot in your shed hardly eats away at your mind every minute of every day, does it?\"\n\nThis was greeted with more yelling, followed by her calling my father, who I don't have a very good relationship with anyway. He was passed on to me, again threatening to call the police on me. Again, I asked how calling the police would have any positive outcome on anybody.

You sound almost desperate to chill with them and react poorly when told no. It's almost as though they've become a mild addiction for you.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for a friend to hang out with just one friend, or just two, and \"exclude\" another. I put exclude in quotations because it's not exclusion so much as it is an ever-changing preference. Sometimes you don't want a big group.

I retort along the lines of \"yes, they may be cunts but you've got the biggest cunt of all (referring to Group B).\" This goes back and forth, with her stating how great her friends are and how much of a cunt group C is, and me retorting they are just as good as group B.\n\nIt got to the point she started to insult me by saying \"who got the girl and who's going to Birmingham?\" This hit me to the core because, I had a crush on her before Best friend starting dating her and referring to how I didn't get my first choice for University. This then lead me to say:\n\"Okay, put bestfriend back on. I was talking to Bestfriend not you, you rude cow.\" Now everyone in Group A has sided with Bestfriend saying I was out of line.\n\nThis isn't the first time she and I have been at odds. So am I the Asshole?\n\nApologies to any Grammatical or spelling errors  ", "score": 0, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3jkn7r", "name": "t3_3jkn7r", "created_utc": 1441336257.0, "title": "AITA for letting my kid play where it makes a dog bark?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 33, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3jkv0z", "name": "t3_3jkv0z", "created_utc": 1441340550.0, "title": "AITA for thinking my gf is wasting my time?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "\nI apologize if this one is a little long.\n\nThe backstory: Been with my gf for 3 years. We live together, and are in the same year of the same program in university. We spend most of our time together, and I genuinely love her to death.\n\nShe frequently asks me to do favors for her, many times a day. She asks me to drive her places (appointments, classes, the gym, friends' houses); get her things from the store; fetch her drinks or make her food; proofread applications, reports, emails, and assignments; and accompany her while she runs errands. She does reciprocate the favor if I ask her for something similar, but I don't regularly ask her for anything, and there is a huge imbalance.\n\nShe asks me for so many favors throughout the day that I feel like I spend more time doing things for her than I do for myself. The part about accompanying her on errands is the one that drives me the craziest. Most of the activities only require one person, and I feel like my involvement is a waste of my time since she is perfectly capable of doing these things by herself.\n\nAlso, we have both spent the entire summer working full time, and begin school again in less than a week. We moved to a new place on Monday, and had only 10 precious days before the start of school (next week on Wednesday). It is now Thursday, and so far we have spent most of our time doing things with very little relevance to the house.\n\nFor instance, on Tuesday, we went shopping for nearly 4 hours so she could buy a raincoat (legitimate need, since it has been pouring here lately and she was scheduled to go kayaking on Wednesday). This resulted in her buying 5 jackets at 3 different stores, 4 of which were returned today after she chose the one she liked the most. On both occasions (the purchase and the return trip) I accompanied her.\n\nThis afternoon (the same day as the return trip) she asked me to come with her to the pharmacy to get a prescription filled. While we waited the 45 minutes for it to be filled, we went shopping in the connected mall, where I watched her try on shoes. I wanted to look in the nearby bookstore, but my request was expressly denied and  we never made it there.\n\nHere is the conflict: I am frustrated and angry with my gf for causing me, in my opinion, to waste the little time I have before school starts. Our program is very intense and I will be doing 12 months straight with very few breaks. So, naturally, I wanted to take some time to relax and refresh before the shit storm starts to brew again. \n\nOur house is still a disaster. We already blew off a camping trip with our friends because we wanted to have enough time to get our shit together. Now though, I don't feel like we will have time to do anything besides organize the house, and I am getting stressed out and frustrated.\n\nAITA for being mad at my gf because I feel like she has wasted my time?", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3jnb0w", "name": "t3_3jnb0w", "created_utc": 1441389432.0, "title": "For completely raging at my friend for not breaking the law for me", "link_flair_text": "no a--holes here", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 22, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3jo5hb", "name": "t3_3jo5hb", "created_utc": 1441402160.0, "title": "AITA for caring about my little brothers health?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "My parents have raised two healthy children(myself included) prior to my brother who is now 6.

I went to the same college as my sister and it was a fairly small school where, if you never met someone before, you probably both know multiple other people.\n\nI had a recitation class and sat near two other guys, call them Ed and Tim. Ed and I ended up becoming good friends. Tim was an alright guy but I didn't know him well. Ed knew him better than I since they were the same major. \n\nThe TA for this recitation was a female graduate student we'll call Wendy. For various reasons we didn't like her much and often joked in private about her being disgusting or a psychopath (in reality she was Ok, it was unfair exaggeration). Though Tim and Ed initiated it, they might not have thought Wendy was Ok.\n\nAfter this term was over I found out somehow that Tim had a crush on my sister, call her Rachel. For some reason this amused me and I came up with a plan. I told Ed and he helped. \n\nTim and I had communicated on AIM somewhat. After the term was over Wendy contacted me about something unrelated and I lied and said there was something wrong with my email, could you IM me. So she did and I got Wendy's AIM screen name.\n\nEd got on AIM ostensibly to chat with various people, including Tim and I, but Ed purposely chose a screen name very similar to Tim's (there was a natural way to do this, given Ed's interests).\n\nThen I fabricated a message to Ed relating Rachel's screen name and regarding some plans to go hiking somewhere, but \"mistakenly\" sent this message to Tim instead of Ed. And instead of my sister's screen name it was Wendy's, the TA we didn't like. So from Tim's perspective he learned Rachel's screen name by accident from me, not knowing I knew anything about his liking Rachel.\n\nI never found out what (might have) happened and it was never mentioned again, but Tim seemed to be more reserved and inhibited around me after that, though it's possible I'm imagining things. And I realize now that, if he initiated conversation with Wendy thinking it's Rachel, he probably would have tried calling her \"Rachel\" early on and figured out it was Wendy before he said anything embarrassing. In any event, nothing ever happened between him and my sister. \n\nHonestly I had no problem with the idea he wanted to date Rachel, I'm not that protective of her or anything. But at the time I was entirely inexperienced with the notion of having feelings for a girl (yea I'm kind of weird like that) and saw Tim's crush as a source of humor.\n\nOn the one hand I sort of feel like an asshole and have some regret about it, since my social grace was underdeveloped especially regarding relationships and I was motivated primarily by the idea of causing awkwardness between Tim and Wendy.

I live in a closely packed condo neighborhood. I wanted to look at something on my bike so i partially pulled in my car to the driveway and left the headlights on for light.

I quickly but profusely apoligized and explained my circumstances but they werent having it. I got the car started after much micromanaging and complaining.

A minute later I send him a text telling him to hurry up because I'm waiting. Then I tell him I'm gonna leave in 4 minutes, because school started in 15 minutes and I had to go to McDonald's and get something to eat because I didn't have time to eat breakfast at home.

I tell him I cant because I can't be late to school again ( I already had 3 tardies. If I get two more before the end of the semester, I'll get detention).

Its not bothering either of us anymore, but it really pissed him off and I was kind of indifferent to it. I wouldn't have left if I was his only way of getting to school.

Sniffles every so often really don't bother me, and I've offered her cold medicine. What's starting to affect my life is her persistent cough.\n\nIt's loud, and wet, and she coughs at least every 30 seconds. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to not be able to focus on my work because of her incessant coughing. It's also affecting her sleep, because the noise either prevents me from falling asleep or wakes me up. This happens very often.\n\nI know Jenna can't help that she's sick, and I'm not trying to blame her for what's out of her control. What is within her control, though, is seeing a doctor (should a cough be persisting for 3 weeks?) or taking some medicine to combat it. So I went out today and bought some cough syrup, and approached her when she got back from class. I told her that I really felt sorry for her that she's been sick for so long, and that I got her some medicine to try to help her feel better. She refused, saying that she doesn't like to take medicine.\n\nAfter she said no the first time, I tried to press the issue, telling her that her coughing, while I know it's out of her control, was starting to affect my concentration and sleep.

So I have a conflict I'm trying to resolve and need external opinions on who is the asshole here. Here is the backstory:\n\nSo the conflict begins with our downstairs PlayStation 3. One member of the household, I will call him *Bob*, notices something is keeping him from being able to login to the netflix app. We have the PS3 setup with multiple *local* accounts, and the only way for *Bob* to login to his netflix account is by being in his local account. One day he opens up the PS3 which auto logs into *my* local account, sees he is not able to login to netflix then sees that because the netflix login is showing my PSN e-mail I must somehow be trying to use their netflix without permission and am fucking up their netflix in general (that isn't true of course. the netflix app login automatically shows the e-mail of the PSN account associated with the logged in *local* account regardless of whether that e-mail actually has access to netflix).\n\nSo the other person, let's call her *Jillian*, finds out about this (she my father's girlfriend) and misinterprets the situation as *Bob* does, gets angry, then sends me this text:\n\n>Please do not create any account and put password in the Netflix/TV in the front..You have no business and should create an account to Netflix that *Bob's* paying..I need to you delete your account in they front room tv...And don't do that ever again..!.\n\nOk, so this text from my perspective is fucking disgusting. For one, she automatically assumes that I must be tampering with netflix and am therefore in the wrong. \"have no business\"...really, is that what you have to say? This is especially offensive because I am known for sticking to what I know is right at all times. I have never logged into netflix, that is just the PS3 showing my info because the wrong *local account* was logged into. Next, she wants me to delete my fucking *account*. Now the fix is easy (to change which local account auto logs in, or just switch the local account at startup), so we have no need for that. Also, I play games on the PS3. I use my local account for my PSN account, and I already have permission to play games on the PS3. Last, she tells me to \"never do that again.\" I didn't do anything in the first place. So basically this text is loaded with a bunch of bullshit assumptions put in a really aggressive \"I didn't think about anything fuck you\" kind of way. \n\nSo the next day I talk to *Bob*, we set it straight, I fix it, we're good (*Bob* and I are always cool but he also sometimes assumes things about what I do, but doesn't get angry about it just waits for someone to solve it). He tells me he's noticed she gets extra pissy at the beginning of the month, and it makes me give her a little more credit, but I'm still not ok with what she said. At that time we do agree that he will talk to her, and that I shouldn't talk to her. Well, being me, I wrongly broke that promise and still wanted to make sure *Jillian* and I were personally on the same level of understanding. So the next day I talk to *Jillian* just to resolve it between us personally. I tell her, look, you misinterpreted what happened, so can we prevent this from happening again in the future? Think about the possibilities of the situation and don't just assume the worst *and* then go about and get loud and make assumptions about me in a text. Now I was very calm in this argument throughout, never trying to offend her, but then she EXPLODES on me and starts telling me how wrong I am, how much of a baby I am that I \"can't take\" her at her worst, and literally throws EVERY insult that relates to my own insecurities which have nothing to do with the actual conversation. She says how \"you have the audacity to come here after a long day, when I haven't thought about this at all today, to give me an **ULTIMATUM** not to text you? Well guess what, if you can't handle me at my worst you sure don't deserve me at my best, if you can't then get the fuck out of this house\". And my response of course was that I just meant any overly assumptive texts like the one she sent me. Not once did I insult her or attempt to spark aggression. \n\nIt was the most ridiculous reaction I have ever seen in any argument I have ever been in. She says she showed the text to her daughter who said it was \"fine\" or some shit. Well guess what, for those who know of MBTI, both her and her daughter are ESFJs so of course you both are blind to what you're actually saying. (I'm an INFP personally. I think thoroughly about everything and when I *know* someone is in the wrong I *know* it, but maybe my perspective here still is wrong). Also, remember *Bob* told me in our original conversation (before I approached *Jillian*) that it could be that it's that time of the month for her/her period (and that he has noticed she gets in this mood at the beginning of the month), which makes it even harder for me to gauge this. Because while she's known for going out of control, it's still extra fucked up even for her. And when I showed the text to my dad even he said \"there's nothing wrong with it, yeah that is something I would have said too\" (he's an ISFJ so he also has similar thought patterns to *Jillian*). But my dad *was* there for the huge argument, and he took my side and was totally not ok with her outburst of insults and anger.\n\nSo this leads to her going on full panic loud aggressive mode and I've been avoiding her for days, she even texted me again saying that she broke up with my dad and it's \"all because of me...congratulations!\" (but every time they \"break up\" they just get back together again for various reasons that are too much to get into right now).\n \nSo, am I the asshole here, or what? My personal conclusion is that while I made a couple *mistakes* in my handling of the situation, I wasn't actually an asshole while she clearly was.

AITA?", "link_flair_text": "no a--holes here", "selftext": "For context, I have a couple roommates and one of them shares the garage with me - he keeps his rarely driven luxury car in it along with my Camry.  Sometime in the past month (roughly early August) I had a few different people stay with me for various reasons, during which time I had more passengers than just myself, and in late August (at least two weeks later) my roommate discovered that somebody had opened my rear door too much and it hit his car, causing some paint to be chipped off (around 4mm in diameter).  I have no clue when or who did this but it likely was somebody that was visiting - it definitely wasn't me since I don't sit in the back but I will take responsibility for my guests.  He notices this and brings it up to me - he says he will go get an estimate on it, I apologize and ask how much he thinks it will be, he has no idea but I just throw out a number of $300 that I would be fine compensating.  He goes and gets a quote from his favorite body shop, they tell him they need to repaint the whole piece (rear fender) and reblend the paint on the entire side of the car, total cost $1,600.  He tells me this and am I shocked on how serious he is - I suppose we live different lives with different priorities, but I can't fathom spending such an insane amount of money to fix such a small paint chip.  However, it's his car and that's what he wants to do and I can certainly respect his intentions but feel this is just such an insane amount of money.  One morning he says he wants to take it to the shop the next day, then heads off to work and so do I, not saying much after.  I decide to send an email telling him that I'm trying to be reasonable and kind here, but $1,600 is just insane, our garage is not a showroom, we have people walk between our cars every day and the car isn't covered, something like this has a chance of happening.  I regret what possibly happened with my friends/family doing this and increased the amount of money I'm willing to pay to $500, but that's really as high as I'm going.  He then decides that insurance is probably the best way to go about this, so I send over my information but I'm not really sure comprehensive covers things like this...in any case I sent things over but haven't heard if it worked or not.\n\nLater that night he and his girlfriend come home (they both live here), my roommate walks right past and the girlfriend comes up to me and says what I'm doing is wrong, that I should have apologized at the beginning and offered my insurance information.  I state how I didn't know this happened (and neither did they) for several weeks, and even now I can't see the paint chip from five feet away.  Also the insurance was just brought up today and I sent over the info.\n\nNow we have an insanely toxic relationship in the house, nobody talks to anybody and this has just made things horrible - I went to a concert last night but couldn't enjoy it because I kept thinking about this whole thing...\n\nAITA?  Assuming the insurance route doesn't pan out, is it reasonable to expect me to dish out $1,600 due to something like this?  Or $500?  Or anything?  I've heard the full range from people, I'd like to crowdsource this thing to see what the universe thinks.  I'm also trying to dig down to the actual truth of the situation and (trying to) paint it as a black and white situation, but really can't.  I think the core of this to me is that I don't really care about minor blemishes on my car, having an immaculate car stresses me out so I'd rather have a few dings to relax about it - clearly my roommate sees things differently.  And if it were something else, like a shirt or tie or appliance or something (or if I wrecked the car for some reason) I would happily replace it, because they are entitled to own that thing and I would have 'taken it away' by breaking it.  But for something like this, where the car functionality was not affected and I STILL can't see the chip from a few feet away, it's just not an expenditure I can empathize with and $1,600 is a lot of money...\n\nSorry for the ramble - once again, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I spoke with my roommate over text today to try and clear things up, stating how I felt it was unreasonable to expect perfection to be maintained in such an environment.  Not to mention our other roommate (that is sadly caught in the middle of this) stated that if he caused this then he couldn't afford $1600, or even $500, and that he had casually spun his keys around or slung his backpack inches from this car on many occasions.  We had no idea that a $2k bill would come up from such a minor mistake.  My roommate didn't take that well, stating that somebody needs to make him whole with this and he will not pay for damage not caused by himself.

We were friends at first.  About three months ago they decided they could not keep their 17 year old cat in the house anymore because he doesn't always use the litterbox and they have an infant they are concerned will get toxoplasmosis as a result of the cat's habits. \n\nThe neighbour wife told me when they made the decision to evict him from the house so we wouldn't let him in the shared hallway which was our habit when he was meowing at our windows.  I said I was not willing to make that agreement to not let him in because he tends to meow at my bedroom window at night to be let in and I don't want her cat to inconvenience me and I also don't think it's cool to throw an elderly cat outside with no shelter.  I offered to find a rescue centre or a new home to take him if they really felt they couldn't care for him any longer.  She left the conversation without discussing rehoming him further or negotiating with me that I don't want the cat living on the shared porch. After that discussion I gave them a covered litterbox with pine shavings to see if that could encourage him to use the litter more. They brought the litterbox in but not the cat.\n\nWe have found the cat without water 6 times in 30+C degree weather. (it's been a hot summer)  The shelter they have provided him is an uncovered bin that I originally put in the shared hallway to organize the miscellaneous baby clothes that get left in there when they come and go from the apt.  \n\nIn one especially hot week we had 7 people within three days come to us and express concern over the cat's welfare. One of those days we had 5 people (it was over 40C degrees with the humidity.)  Early that day my SO was confronted by a passerby who wanted to know if he was a stray.  At that moment the neighbour wife came home and said to the passerby that it's her cat but they could take him if they want.  Later on that night an Animal Rescue volunteer who had stopped a raccoon from attacking him rang our doorbell at 1130pm. We came out and addressed the situation, made sure he was okay and clarified he was owned and not a stray (he is thin, has a ripped ear and his coat is dull so it's easy to confuse him as being homeless.)\n\nI did my research that night and found someone close by who was willing to take him in.  At this point I was still friends with the neighbours.  The next day I confronted the wife when she came into the backyard and said that it's really uncool we keep having to respond to people about her cat when it's known we do not like the idea of him living on the porch.  I said that I found him a home if they are willing.  That's when she flipped saying that I was trying to steal her cat and it was none of our business.  When I brought up that she told someone to take him she said she was joking.  We continued to yell at each other until my SO came out and diffused the situation. (SO is not as hotheaded as I am) SO told her that she needs to get the cat a collar, register him with the city, provide more appropriate shelter and we will not tolerate being inconvenienced by him again.  That night she sent us a series of texts saying that we have no business talking to people about her cat and that I am trying to force her hand to get rid of him and that we share a backyard, not a life. That's when the friendship ended.\n\nThe next day my buddy came by and felt it was necessary to report the treatment of the cat to animal services.  A few days later animal services came by but the neighbours wouldn't answer their door so we addressed the call.  The animal services rep said that city bylaws allow a cat to be permanently outdoors so long as they are not a nuisance.  She did note that the cat was not registered and was slightly dehydrated and wrote up a warning notice.  We confirmed with her that he is a nuisance to us but not in that annoying sense more that we are tired of dealing with seeing him in that condition and we are tired of people knocking on our door.  \n\nSo, main question is, what they are doing is not against the law but we feel it's an inconvenience to us. Are we just too uptight?  They have retaliated aggressively that I will leave out in the main body so we can determine if we caused this issue by being assholes. They do give him food every day and are now bringing the food (not the cat) in at night after I complained about the raccoons and animal services came by. \n\nI have pics of the porch and cat if that will help yous determine if I'm the asshole.

I told both of them that I find it disgusting that there is fingernail clippers and wart remover where I regularly eat (with the implication that they are being used there). My brother shrugs at her and I tell her that it is disgusting and that is like doing it at a kitchen table. She retorts that there is cleaners for table tops and to just use that (with the implication of \"you have the issue, you deal with it and clean the area\"). I snap back that if I see them there again, I will throw them both away and end the conversation.\n\nTalking to my brother about this after she left (shit like this would be better coming from him) he tells me that I am being overly sensitive and we both get defensive and snippy. I end up telling him that it wasn't that big of a deal but I still rather it not happen and her, a guest in mine and my brothers home, telling me to clean up after herself is fucked up and disrespectful.\n\nTL:DR my brothers girlfriend makes a mess every weekend and does things I find gross to do at a place I eat often AT a place I eat often and tells me to clean up the area if it bugs me.

Then C. and L. broke up about 5-8 months ago from the point of today this caused me too back away from L. because i felt she had issues of her own she had to deal with and i was just weighing her down. (by this i mean that her head wasn't in the right state and she didn't need another guy around her) Also another reason for me backing away was because i know how easily she falls for guys and if i were to still talk to her whilst she was single she would want me to date her which i wasn't willing to do. Throughout this time i moved away from my old group (the asshole group) bringing my best friend with me (Not C.) into a group that i felt was better and so far it has been. However this has caused me and C. to stop all contact with each other as he decided to stay with some members of the old group who i felt were assholes themselves. Anyway now with a very long backstory out of the way we can get into todays topic of me sleeping with L. so we were both at a party, i was drinking and she was not, we didn't really talk to each other throughout the night because as i said we hadn't really spoken like we used to for about 5-8 months. At this party we were both sleeping the night at the house as we are both kind of close friends with the host. We didn't speak for the first few hours of the party but as the night kicked in we both started talking again like we used too (This was at about 2am and i was kind of drunk) people began to fall asleep and we decided to grab a blanket and sleep on the couch together. Although we didn't have sex we did other stuff which I'm not going to go into detail with. So basically we stayed up all night doing stuff and then we both agreed to not tell anyone. (Ofcourse being a guy i told my 4 best friends from my group everything) This leads me to the day after where once we were home we talked over Facebook for a while and then went to sleep for about 12 hours since not getting any sleep the night before. Now this leads me to today, she has asked me to go to the movies and i really don't want to go so i declined because i feel like she has developed feelings and is trying to start a relationship which i really don't want to get into at this point in my life. So i guess I'm just here asking for advice from you guys if i'm an asshole or not. Right now I'm just sitting in my room listening to red hot chilli peppers writing this message. Any help is appreciated and i can take constructive criticism.\n\nSo reddit, am i an Asshole for sleeping with a girl who was once my best friends girlfriend or should i let it go?", "score": 12, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3ng2wy", "name": "t3_3ng2wy", "created_utc": 1443961865.0, "title": "AITA for not inviting our neighbors to my husband's birthday party at our house?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "We hang out with them when it's neighborhood stuff, but this party was a reunion of his old work friends and the two crowds have little in common.

My bestfriend always talk shit about C like she's a slut and stuff to me and that she hates her. So couple months later I get a class with C and we sat next to each other.

A little history first:\n\n - I've known Katie since 6th grade and we are both 22 now. We've had the same group of friends ever since we met and have continued to be in the same small group of friends up until this all happened. Katie started acting weird ever since we finished our undergrad. I mean weird as in she had been more anti-social, more critical of strangers, and just generally less pleasant to be around. I talked about it with a couple of my other friends in our group and they agreed that she'd been acting weird ever since she didn't get her dream job coming out of school.\n\n - Matt and I met my sophomore year of high school and he and I instantly became good friends. He was a year younger than I and I was already in a relationship (that lasted until I was 20), so I never thought of him as more than a good friend. He would listen to me if I was having trouble with my boyfriend and I would listen to him bitch about whatever problems he was having. We would go a month or two without contact sometimes, but would pick up wherever we left off once we ran into each other again.\n\n - Well around the time I broke up with my boyfriend, Matt and Katie started dating. I thought it was the best thing in the world because two of my good friends were dating. Well I was wrong. They were together for a little over a year and in that time they fought for at least half of it. Katie was downright mean to Matt. She told him his friends were always annoying, that she didn't really like his parents, that his hobbies (mostly playing his instruments) were dumb, etc. In hindsight, I should have sad something. But when either would bitch to me about how the other had done something stupid, I insisted that I was to stay neutral because it wouldn't be fair to either of them if I took a side. They both respected my decision.\n\nSo Matt and Katie broke up back in December of 2014, but kept in contact until the end of March this year. I saw Matt, without Katie being with him, for the first time in about 6 months in mid-April of this year and we chatted for a little bit. He told me how much happier he was without Katie and I just said I was glad he was happy.\nThen we started talking more and more throughout the month. It was the first time we had been friends without one of us in a relationship so we were beginning to talk like never before. And by the end of May this year we had started dating.\n\nWhile all that was happening, I was thinking about how Katie would react. I knew it may not be right, but it had been 5 months since they broke up and she was a major bitch to him half the relationship. So I told her a week before we started dating and she was infuriated. All she told me was that it wasn't okay and that she didn't approve at all. She has avoided seeing me at all costs and it has put some tension in our group of friends. She refuses to discuss it with anyone as well.\n\nMy logic is that they broke up 5 months before we started dating and she was a jerk to him for so long. Her logic, I'm assuming, is that I betrayed her.

I've been a part of their group for about a year, and to date they're the only people who I can confidently point to and call my friends. However, about half a year ago my depression has picked up. I frequently have fears about being abandoned by this group and reverting back to eating alone at the lunch table as I have done for basically my entire life. During this summer I have attempted suicide twice, and at the beginning of the school year I've been hospitalized once for a serious suicide attempt. Now I am seeing a school counselor in weekly checkups to ensure that I'm mentally well, and my parents have locked away the medication to prevent further attempts.\n\nHowever, this fear is still there, and on a bi-weekly basis I have breakdowns in which I'd turn to my friends for support and help. Although they are there for me I can tell that these breakdowns are taking a toll on them, and that they'd now think twice before planning anything to ensure that I'm well first (the thing that triggered my suicide attempt was an outing they had which they had not informed me about). I can definitely feel that there has been a change in our group dynamic- one that makes me more important than I used to be- and I feel responsible and to an extent guilty for that. \n\nMy breakdowns involve a need to be re-assured that I'm still close to them, and they are a source of stress for the entire group. I have tried to alleviate this stress in many ways, including not turning to them for help as frequently (I call the suicide hotline and use online resources) and not alerting them to the fact that I am about to abuse substances (I still do that on a frequent basis but I don't want to alert them to it) but I still do sometimes need to talk to them and every single time I do that everyone in the group gets extremely stressed out. \n\nI feel very guilty for making them stressed out and in response I've tried to be there for them as much as I can, and I'd, on my own initiative, ask them if they were feeling okay if it was apparent they weren't and try to make them feel better. But I still do feel like I'm more of a burden rather than a member in this group, and sometimes I feel like the best solution to all of this, the best answer that satisfies everyone is to simply cut myself off from this group. I cause a lot of stress and worry and I really do feel like I don't give enough back. But apparently people still want to hold onto sources of stress, and they pull me back in and act as if nothing happened. \n\nI don't know how to give back to them for being there for me as much as they can and I don't know how to cut myself off in order to make everyone happy again. I feel sometimes that suicide is the answer, and that although they seem to don't want it subconsciously they do want me gone because I'm such a burden on everything. I just want to fit in, and by doing so I've become an incredible burden on everything. I feel like I'm taking too much and giving back nothing. \n\nSo am I an asshole for causing so many troubles to everyone around me? Am I an asshole for being me? \n\nPlease respond honestly. To be honest I am sick and tired of fake positivity. Thank you.

I temporarily dyed my hair to match the part I was cast for, he started learning extra features of the video editing software, I created a DVD Case and an accompanying Soundtrack (with custom CD boxart) and a poster for the movie, and my friend started studying fight choreography to nail the fight scenes in our trailer. We got a few of our friends to agree to act in it, and we even talked about filming the entire movie even though we were only submitting the trailer for class. \n\nBut then a couple of days into the project, our teacher informed us this other guy in the class was joining the group. Just to clarify (as it is an important point in the story, not part of my decision), this guy was physically handicapped (wheelchair-bound). I mention this because as soon as we suggested he find someone else to work with (as he had differing desires for a project entirely), we got berated by others for discrimination and bullying, purely because he was handicapped. We relented and allowed him to join. He immediately looked at what we had done, and wanted to change key points of the trailer to be more drama based. He didn't like the vampires from the source material (having never read the books, refused to, and instead based his knowledge off of our shorthand notes),so he wanted the vampires to be closer to those of Twilight. \n\nMy friend and I found it stressful, but couldn't see an alternative. We continued as always, planning stuff out and researching. A day before we're supposed to shoot our first scene, he tells us we need to film at his place instead of the filming locations we found (and based the script around) near my friend's house and my house. Lacking transportation to his house 5 miles away, I apologised and said I couldn't make it. He then informed the teacher during their weekly review session that I wasn't making an effort, and I was locking him out of decisions. \n\nI ended up telling the teacher there needed to be an alternative, as we had worked hard on our project, and lost all enthusiasm as we were forced into working with someone that was manipulative, overdemanding, and wanted to change our plans to what he preferred. My partner agreed it was for the best, and the other guy had to do a solo project (a much simpler one to account for the lack of a group, he ended up writing mock magazine about music which he highly preferred). Regardless, he treated me with disdain ever since, going as far as to spin the story that I just hated him and wanted to see him fail, and that the only reason my partner vetoed his presence in the group was due to me pressuring him. Despite the mixed feeling amongst other students our age over what happened, we ended up thoroughly enjoying the project and won an award (as well as an A*/A+ grade). \n\nTL;DR Dismissed a guy the teacher assigned to our movie project because he refused to look at the source material, demanded we do things by his schedule and got many students to think we were (and I quote) \"cripple haters\".", "score": 9, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3oy117", "name": "t3_3oy117", "created_utc": 1444965781.0, "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that going to someones birthday/passion party is weird?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "My girlfriend told me a friend of a friend is having a birthday/passion party.

My school is very \"historic,\" so in addition to the old furniture, the lighting is kind of dim.\n\nMy professor is great, but he doesn't have a ton of clear discussion policies when we're talking about a text (it's an English class). I'd say most people in the class, including me, raise hands to be recognized about 75% of the time. However, there are definitely many moments when, due to the pace of the conversation, people just tend to jump in without waiting--usually when the room has been silent for a little while, or when someone is asking someone else a direct question.\n\nToday in class, the professor posed a question, and there was silence for a little bit before I spoke up to answer (without raising my hand). However, as soon as I started talking, I realized my professor had begun to gesture towards another student, who was evidently raising her hand. I didn't initially see due to the nature of the room, but I (in a split second) figured it would be better to keep going than to cut myself off, so I finished my thought. My comment ended up sending the conversation down a different path than the original question (even though my answer was relevant, I promise), and I ended up feeling bad that the other woman never got to share her thought. \n\nWhen we entered the last five minutes of class, the professor asked if anyone had any lingering questions or comments. I piped up and said, \"I was just wondering if [student I interrupted] had any thoughts about [question from before]?\" (This type of question isn't atypical for the class--people often ask for a specific someone's opinion during the last few minutes because we all have fairly specific areas of expertise). \n\nI scooted forward in my seat to see her reaction, and she kind of embarrassedly and dismissively said \"Oh, not really...\" I felt really bad for putting her on the spot, but I also felt a little embarrassed myself because she hadn't answered my question.

We drank a good bit (not so much that we were blacking out), and then we decided to go swimming in his apartment complex's pool. The water was freezing, so I suggested we take a hot shower. I figured Rachel and Max would shower together, and I'd shower after. Rachel invited me to shower with them, though, and drunk me thought this was a fine idea.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happened. Rachel began to kiss me, we took our bikini tops off, and we had a threesome. The only guideline Rachel gave me was not to have vaginal sex with Max, and I didn't. We engaged purely in oral, although he ended up having sex with her while she and I did other stuff.\n\nI don't remember getting back home, but I did. I didn't spend the night there. I woke up to Rachel asking if she could come over. She did, and she basically told me that she was angry I agreed to having the threesome. Her reasoning was that she was more intoxicated than I was (she did drink more, but as I said, no one was to the point of blacking out), and since I was \"more sober,\" I should have known it would be a bad idea. I told her that this was ridiculous, as all three of us consented. She told me she doesn't know if we can continue to be friends. I think this is stupid. If I had been 100% sober, of course I would have recognized that might have bad consequences. But I was pretty fucked up too, so I don't feel I'm at fault.

What should be noted is that this is not the first of these conversations that have happened in the clan chat. The other conversations have been equally foolish and bigoted, but equally earnest, as though the people involved felt they were educating each other.\n\nWhen I woke up and read the posts I responded with \"Wow, you're ignorant as fuck. Guess the standards are lower where you are.\" This prompted a number of others to go back and read the conversation, and many actually left the clan out of disgust. This was all I wrote on the situation and I did not ask anyone to leave. Up to this point I had refrained from participating in clan chats, except for occasional frivolities, and the extent of my involvement in the clan was simply completing my war attacks and donating troops (I was always one of the heaviest donators in the clan).\n\nThe son of the prime bigot called the people who left \"buthole\" and told me that I can't talk to his dad like that, to which I responded \"Then tell your dad to grow up.\"\n\nLater in the day I discovered I was booted from the clan. I don't care too much about that. My only link to the clan was that my brother and niece are in it as well, but when they discovered what happened they left too. All the same, it was a generally positive/supportive clan with good engagement and activity. Having been booted from the clan I am no longer able to participate in clan discussions, but I can still read them, and this was posted by the prime bigot:\n\n\n>I personally feel the comments directed at me were a hell of a lot worse that what bronco and I discussed.

Prepare for some cringe.\n\n**Some other background info on me and ideas I have of what she's like:**\n\n-I have severely struggled with social anxiety, constant negative thoughts about myself and have been going through some weird shit with family and questioning life and all that crap. I'm your average angsty young adult, that likes games, programming, metal and thinks he's the best next thing. Until real life happens and I realize I'm just another kid who has much to learn.\n\n-She seems very self-conscious about her looks, her family is very traditional and I have the feeling they protect her a bit more than normal. She has been going through some existential crisis too. I rather not make many assumptions since we barely know each other even though I have a strong feeling that we both have VERY similar views of ourselves. This may seem pretentious but the way I see it is she is like a female version of me, but in the past when I did not know how to control my anxiety. Silly, but it feels very reasonable to me when I think about everything that we talked about and both our reactions throughout this whole thing. \n\nTo make it simple, I take a more realistic approach towards my negative thoughts and try to see things from a \"this is my head making shit up\" while she seems to let it get to her on a very personal, emotional level(Something I used to do a lot and still go back to doing when I let my guard down).\n\n**What happened:**\n\n\n\nI met this girl through facebook and we agreed to go out for some shit talking, some walking around and food. Simple stuff that wouldn't necessarily imply it being a \"date\" as far as I knew. I did not make it obvious that it was supposed to be a date and I did not make it obvious that it wasn't either, so that's my first mistake I believe. My intention was to leave it as an open, lightweight thing where we would both decide, as mature people(or I thought), if we wanted to go through with a relationship.\n\nWhat happened was something a bit unexpected to me. Since we had never actually met before, and only talked via messages, I had no idea how her personality and looks were \"in real life\". Via messaging she came across as being a very controlled, smart, fun person. In reality, I quickly noticed she took her negative thoughts on a more personal level than I had thought. Also, and this is another part where I feel like a huge asshole, I did not feel physically attracted to her as I had predicted. The last came as a bit of a shock and I still struggle to wrap my head around the concept of me, a guy so self conscious, gives that many shits about how someone looks like. \n\nWe were both very awkward, but anyone that has been through social anxiety will relate when I say that it makes a world of difference what you decide to do with your thoughts after they start showing up on your mind. I took it all light-heartedly, aware that I've been struggling with this, and that there was not much I could do about other than keep reminding myself to just let those thoughts go fuck themselves and concentrate on having fun, and hope that she was doing the same in her own mind. And it seemed that everything was going that way like that throughout the whole thing a very lightweight thing, which felt fine for the first few hours, we talked about a bunch of crap and had a good time until I realized it was dawning on her the realization that maybe I was not interested in taking it to the next level. So for the rest of the day, there it was, two young anxious people, with different ways of approaching their mental problems. Both trying to hide the fact that one is interested and the other is not.\n\nThen we both went home, after a shitty goodbye that felt like we just had a small talk on public transport rather than having spent the whole day together.\n\nThen there was me feeling like shit, being all worried about how I should've said something to make it easier for her, to maybe make it clear if she really was interested or if I was overestimating how interested she was in me, but then knowing if I asked it could've made the whole thing more serious than I had wished for. I open up facebook to go over our messages to maybe light something in me, to make me want to be with her, only to find she deactivated her whole account. Now yes, out of 365 days in a year maybe, just maybe she decided today that facebook is crap and just helps you procrastinate. But something in me worries that this is not the case. And now I feel like the shittiest asshole of all time.\n\nAITA?\n\n", "score": 23, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3pityq", "name": "t3_3pityq", "created_utc": 1445364813.0, "title": "AITA for making my roommate lag when I stream on Twitch", "link_flair_text": "everyone sucks", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3pj8ty", "name": "t3_3pj8ty", "created_utc": 1445370174.0, "title": "AITA for expecting a little professionalism in professional emails?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3pjmwh", "name": "t3_3pjmwh", "created_utc": 1445375325.0, "title": "Am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to \"DJ\" around me?", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "So for the past few days my boyfriend got a new phone and has been playing with some kind of music app around me in which he's mixing songs together.

I said \"Fucking musicians don't care that nobody wants to hear them practice.\" And explained that I'm subjected to practicing musicians daily and don't want to be subjected to this at home.

I'll get you a cab, but I'm really disappointed you did not think this through.\" He thinks it's not a big deal because he got me where I needed to be and figured he would figure the rest out as he went along, but that kind of thing makes me wonder if he's even a reliable enough person to be my boyfriend.

He knows already that I don't like what I call 'song ADD' wherein a person doesn't play an entire song and keeps skipping and that's basically what he's doing with this app. I've also said \"Remixing a song is like admitting you were wrong\" or \"Why would they remix this song, it's perfect in it's original form\" and other such things, so he does already know that I don't like this sort of thing.\n\nSo which one of us is the bigger asshole right now?

He's super busy with work so I play it cool. I don't want to be a dick. Like I said the guy is really nice, and I would like the roommate relationship to start off on the right foot. Fast forward 2+ weeks - The guy still hasn't moved in due to 'being so busy with work' and still has not paid. We're at the 20th of the month when he finally gets to moving in, and I bring up getting paid for rent.\nHe hangs his head and immediately things get awkward. He starts saying things like, \"yeahh, it just sucks paying full rent for 10 days, I know it's what we agreed upon but still... etc. etc.\" I'm pretty unsympathetic since I feel I've been extremely patient with the whole thing. I handle it well and am just like \"dude, I know it sucks but that's what the deal is. You can't just decide not to move-in and then not pay rent.\" I basically do the whole, 'not my problem' thing without being a dick. He reluctantly agrees and pays like a sad puppy.\nAnd here I am, feeling like an asshole for making him pay rent. Honestly, if he would've tried to set something up in the beginning about pay half-rent or whatever I would've been open to it.\nShould I feel like an asshole? Should I maybe throw him a portion of the rent back? Really seeking validation here. I 100% feel like I'm in the right here, but there are still pangs of guilt.\nWould like to hear your opinion on this petty issue here, Reddit.\n\n\nEdit: Guys thank you for the feedback.

I don't know if they'll share it with anyone past that and I have potentially sensitive information on there\n\n* It doesn't feel right to me that I work to pay for it and he would get it for free\n\n* I don't want him fucking with my playlists (selfish but ya know)\n\n* I don't want him deleting/locking me out of my account somehow\n\n(Again I trust this person to some degree but those are still my reasons.)\n\nI explained these points to him and he got pissed at me for not letting him have it. I called on our friend Evan as a third party and Evan agreed with my reasons and respected them but also sided with Drew slightly saying that it was a dick move to not let him use it. In my opinion he's not neutral because he mostly sides with Drew on this (and other things)\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not letting a guy use my Spotify premium account for the above reasons?

I started working in the middle of a pay week so I only got about half of the pay that I would have expected, (The amount of money doesn't matter in this situation). So I set up my direct deposit having 65% going into my debit card, and 35% going into a savings account for books and other school stuff next semester. For some reason, the payroll office canceled my savings account before my first paycheck. No big deal really, I just got about $45 in my debit card and the rest came as a check in the mail a couple days later. So here's where the annoying shit starts to happen. \n\nThe day before I get payed the second time, a pay stub goes out online. When I got home I went to see how much money I was supposed to get and when I checked, it said my money was going into a credit card at a bank which I don't have an account with. My first though is that someone is committing fraud and it trying to take my money. This was at around 7 o'clock, so the bank and the payroll office were both closed and I went to bed pissed off. The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\n\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \n\n\nEdit: Ended up not calling.

Unfortunately I can't play any time I want because it's my roommate's Xbox1 and I can only get a lot done when he's working and I'm not. Which is Thursday and Friday evening and Saturday and Sunday.  \n  \nMy mom and I[23F] are really close. We share just about everything with each other, and ate sometimes more friends than mother/daughter. I moved out in June because of my brother and dad and it was good timing for my friend/roommate who was moving out. For the first few months, I was really good about going over once a week for laundry and to watch the shows that I normally watch with her. October has been tough though. I went out of town, started a new job (in addition to my 9-5), was helping with my best friends wedding, and, of course, playing Destiny. I haven't been over in at least a few weeks.  \n  \nTHE INCIDENT IN QUESTION: The new hard mode raid came out recently and I've been trying so hard to beat it. This is my first fps so I'm not very good. I've had a friend who has very patiently been helping me get through it, but we still get people who rage quit because I keep dying,which I take very personally. I played a few hours on the raid Thursday and Friday and was planning on beating it yesterday, thinking I had 4 hours til my roommate got home and might jump on Halo. We originally had plans to play scary games with our other friend and drink and have a good dinner as well. Well he got home and I still wasn't done. He was totally ok with it though. I'm 4 hours in at that point, stressed/tense as hell, feeling like it's totally my fault we're not being successful and really tired too. We're trying to beat the final boss and I had just died and we wiped to start it over when there's a knock on the door. It was my parents. No call or text warning. If it was any other time, I'd have been happy to see them. But I was like a deer stuck in headlights. I didn't know what to do. I told my group to hold on a sec and someone bounced. I was so torn i was about to cry. I'm 6 hours in and so dedicated to just getting it over with.  \n  \nMy mom said that it was fine! They thought about calling and realized at that point that they should have. At that point they left.  \n  \nThen today I figured since I didn't have plans, I'd go do laundry there and hang out. My mom didn't answer her phone so I called my dad and he said my mom was sleeping but come on over for laundry. I get there and go see my mom and she looks sad and tired. Come to find out she hasn't gotten out of bed all day because she hasn't stopped crying about last night. She said she wanted to surprise me last night and thought I'd be really happy to see her, but that I looked \"disgusted\" that they showed up. She said she didn't say she was upset the night before because she didn't want to make a scene. She had expectations (hang out, see my place cuz she hasn't been there in a while, have me take a picture of them in their costumes), and was devastated that I disappointed her because I've never been the source of that kind negative feelings for her.  \n  \nIs this just a fucked up situation where we both should have done something different?

You can't control those feelings, so don't beat yourself up for them.\n\nIt's your actions that can make you an asshole, and it doesn't seem like you've done anything wrong. As far as you venting to other people it really depends on who they were and what you said. If you insulted him or demeaned him for not liking you or something, in a way that could possibly identify him to people that know him personally, then yeah that's kind of a dick move because it could get back to him and hurt his feelings, or make those people you talked to feel uncomfortable and involved in drama that they don't need.

It's understandable to be frustrated and angry when you're feelings aren't met or you aren't getting the relationship you want from somebody. That makes you feel shitty, and it's ok to express your emotions and vent to your loved ones. That's what loved ones are there for.\n\nLastly, the issue with who your dating is tricky, but if you two aren't serious and/or exclusive, and the person youre seeing KNOWS and is ok with that, then it's ok to pursue this other guy. However the important part is making sure the person you're with now knows where they stand. It's not cool to lead someone on, but it is ok to \"play the field\" and casually date or pursue more person at a time. Anyway from what you've said it seems like you mean well and don't want to hurt anyone. So don't be afraid to acknowledge and respect how you feel and see where those feelings lead you.

We recorded one album and started a second but people got busy with college and what have you. Some time goes by and I have the guitarist send me the files for the second album and chat with some of the guys about finishing it. In 2012 I move back down to Los Angeles and meet with the guitarist over unrelated business. The subject of the second album comes up and my recollection of things is that he basically gives me his blessing to take over guitar duties on the album. He hadn\u2019t recorded anything and my understanding was that he didn\u2019t even play guitar anymore (and in fact I had purchased two of his guitars from him). And honestly I think I was probably a little too excited about taking over. You can probably see where this is going.\n\nSo fast-forward to a year or two later. I record guitar and keys at our friend\u2019s studio. We bring in our bassist to record bass. Our vocalist lays down vocals. Our sax player does his thing. Photos are published to Facebook. People are excited but there\u2019s a lot of \u201cman, I wish Guitarist was here\u201d talk. Giant red flag, in hindsight. In November of last year I get a text from our sax player to the effect of \u201cGuitarist is pissed. You need to call him\u201d. I call him right away. He is, in fact, quite pissed. \u201cHow could you go behind my back like this??\u201d I say that I thought we had worked it out and everything was cool. He says \u201cThat was two years ago. I don\u2019t even remember having the conversation\u201d I apologize and say \u201cwhat can I do to make it right?\u201d He says \u201cI\u2019ll think about it and call you back\u201d I feel sick.\n\nA day goes by. Two. Three. A week. A month.  I call him in January (of this year) and leave a message. No reply. Drummer calls him a couple months later. No reply. In July I buy a ticket to his EDM show in the hopes that I can force an interaction. Well, he\u2019s doing quite well and spends the whole show in the VIP lounge of the swanky club where he\u2019s performing. I text him and he texts me the next morning: \u201cDude, you were at our show?? Awesome!\u201d We have a brief back and forth and I don\u2019t push anything. I wait a couple of weeks and then ask if he has weekend plans. No response. I texted him today on his birthday like I always do. He says \u201cThanks man. Hope you\u2019re well\u201d. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m autistic or something.\n \nAnyway, I know I fucked up initially but I feel like I tried to make it right. So who\u2019s the asshole here?

I am, at the moment, a sophomore in high school (16 years old, contrary to my user name). My mother and I generally have a great relationship. However, when it comes to creative differences, she and I clash.\n\nI would like to point out that this is not a new issue, only that we had yet another one of our fights, and I don't know how to feel about it anymore.\n\nFor my art class, I am creating an [artist trading card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_trading_cards) in the style of an artist named Jamie Poole. [His art style is using text to create images.](http://imgur.com/a/FVFR0) As you can see, it is a tedious style to remake. Because of this, I was (and still am) unsure of what to make on the card. So, I asked my mother. \n\nShe said something along the lines of, \"something that reminds you of home.\" I replied, somewhat abruptly, \"how would I manage to put that on a tiny card?\" She was clearly very offended, so I apologized and asked her to continue. She had said (again, I am paraphrasing), \"well if you make a house, it would be easy because there are straight lines.\" I wasn't really fond of this idea, but I knew I was on thin ice at this point. Because I didn't want to offend her further, I replied with a neutral \"okay.\" Now, typing this, I see how that seems like I was being facetious, but that thought didn't even cross my mind. I said it in a manner that suggested I felt as though I were walking on egg shells (somewhat condescending, or even patronizing). She got pissed.\n\nAfter a few moments pause, I apologized. But of course, I had to ruin it by saying \"sorry.... for saying okay.\" Looking back, I see that this is very immature.\n\nAn argument commenced. She asked why I ask for her opinions if I reject them, I asked why she got offended when all I said was \"okay.\" She said she was offended by my initial reaction, I told her I apologized (granted, I did). \n\nAt the end of it all, I did apologize genuinely for offending her. However, I fear she thinks I was being facetious again, as I said it with a somewhat angry tone (it is difficult for me to sound genuine after an argument, even if I am).\n\nAgain, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. It happens quite frequently with writing and art. I continue to ask her because I respect her opinion, but sometimes, I don't think her initial ideas will necessarily work out in my favor. It is usually the same or a similar argument as above. Me asking my mother for advice, rejecting her first idea, and her storming off because she is offended. \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n^^^Also, ^^^if ^^^you ^^^have ^^^any ^^^ideas ^^^as ^^^to ^^^what ^^^to ^^^make ^^^for ^^^my ^^^project, ^^^^that ^^^^^would ^^^^^be ^^^^^^peachy\n", "score": 8, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3rjr4t", "name": "t3_3rjr4t", "created_utc": 1446674140.0, "title": "AITA for not being a man of my word?", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3rk1wn", "name": "t3_3rk1wn", "created_utc": 1446678601.0, "title": "AITA for finding my mom so annoying", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3rmbrv", "name": "t3_3rmbrv", "created_utc": 1446725337.0, "title": "AITA For not wanting to let people kiss me on the cheek?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3road7", "name": "t3_3road7", "created_utc": 1446755652.0, "title": "AITA for finding my mom so annoying?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3rqhn8", "name": "t3_3rqhn8", "created_utc": 1446792506.0, "title": "AITA for saying the Berkeley Protests were a dumb idea and wont accomplish anything?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "There was a protest today in Berkeley.

I am usually the one who has to clean up his messes to make the room bearable to live or I need to constantly hint to him that he should pick some of his stuff up. \nWell after coming back from home this weekend I found that while I was gone my roommate covered my desk with his stuff, food wrappers, bowls, and plates, and I needed to clear half the stuff just to put down my laptop. I refused to touch the rest of the items since it shouldn't be my job to deal with his trash. Well yesterday I asked him three times to clear his stuff away but he never did and once he said \"no\", not sure if he was joking or not. That night I went to our friends place to study and he asked me to bring back his laptop charger that he left behind. Usually, I would bring it back with no hesitation however since I find he didn't care to clean his trash off my desk I told him I would only bring back his charger if he sends me a snapchat of my desk clean. During the night I sent him a snapchat of his charger saying \"Is my desk clean yet\" and I saw he opened it but no reply and I even texted him later and got no reply, unsure if he read it. I decided not to bring back his charger since I assumed he didn't clean my desk. When I got back to my room I saw he was asleep and that he did indeed clean off my desk. He woke up and asked if I brought back his charger to which I said \"Oh I forgot my bad\"\nAm I the asshole?", "score": 2, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3s6cn1", "name": "t3_3s6cn1", "created_utc": 1447099779.0, "title": "AITA: Buying something just to avoid exiting by the same exit that my friends?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "Before anything, sorry for my english, it's not my native language.\n\nSome context, last weekend, I hanged out with my friends and friend's friends to pass the day, we were a group of seven and decided to pass a good time.\n\nDuring the day we ended in a little mall, and ended buying some videogames.\n\nNo, this is when things when problematic, one of the members of the group R.

Basically, Bruce has been in the closet his whole life and never told anyone about the guy he was seeing, because he was afraid that his family, boss, and/or friends wouldn't accept him if he admitted he was gay.  Turns out no-one on that list is bothered by the gay thing at all.  (A couple people said \"I always knew\" because Bruce conforms to a few stereotypes, but no-one has a problem with it or is trying to distance themselves.)\n\nSo now that he's told a few people, Bruce's friends are finally starting to get details about the new guy (but only a sister and a niece met him in the Justice of the Peace's office).  Most interestingly, Bruce has only known the guy for three months, and this new husband needs a green card, but \"that's totally not what it's about\".  Also, as details start to bleed out, I begin to realize that the new husband's story is matching up to a mysterious acquaintance Bruce has been complaining about for a few months.  Turns out the new guy is getting sued for some civil thing that sounds like a crime to me, and has a dog he absolutely refuses to take proper care of, and just seems more and more like a general sleazebag every time a new story comes out.  \n\nEveryone we both know is afraid to say a word to Bruce about any of these problems, because they don't want to seem homophobic...and the marriage has already happened, so it's a little late to say the guy isn't good enough.  But I've decided not to be quiet, and told Bruce a week after the announcement that anyone can appear to be ok for a few months...it can take years to discover that someone is a nut or a monster, and it sounds like his mystery guy is already looking like someone you don't want to enter a long-term life commitment with.  \n\nDespite the fact that he asked what I think many times, Bruce told me to mind my own business and is now pissed at me for \"badmouthing his husband\".  But the way I look at it, this is a consequence of him concealing the relationship until after eloping.

Last year we spent Christmas together with my Mom at her house. His family lives pretty far away, but he spent the days leading up to, and the days following with his family. \n\nIn my ideal world, we'd take turns doing Christmas with his family and then with mine, so it is technically his family's turn this year. However my family is a shit show, which complicates matters. \n\nMy Dad thankfully can spend it with two of his other daughters, so I dont worry about him. However, I am essentially my Mom's only child, since my full sister hasn't spoken to my mom in about 10 years. She is also a pretty big loner, so if I dont spend Christmas with her she will be totally alone. Not my fault, but none the less something I have to deal with.\n\nI just told my husband that I'd like to spend Christmas with my Mom and New Years with him and his family. He can come with me if he wants, but if he wants to go see his family then I totally support that. He full on freaked out. He thinks my Mom is manipulative and he thinks that its her fault that she is alone. He also thinks she's been behaving particularly badly lately, so he's not exactly sympathetic to her.\n\nI've tried to somehow please all people but my Mom doesn't want to spend Christmas at his family's house, so that's out. No one else can spend Christmas with my Mom.\n\nThe logistics also make it very challenging. I only get Christmas day off, so I'd fly on Christmas Eve and then fly back 3 days later. Flights are incredibly expensive, which is just depressing.\n\nAITA for choosing to spend Christmas with my Mom so she isn't alone, and in doing so choosing her over my husband?\n\n**Update:**\nThanks for the honest comments. Its really helpful to have an unbiased audience bc my husband and mom kid of butt heads, often putting me in an awkward place. Both seem to think I am being ridiculous, and I feel pulled in 100 directions unable to decide which is fair and right.\n\nI just called my mom and it went as expected... She said that after the way I handled our wedding (explained below) a few months ago she is not surprised that I would change my mind and decide to go to my husbands family. So essentially she is as pissed off/hurt as I thought she'd be. I pray that this isn't the final nail in the coffin of our relationship. It was already pretty fragile.\n\nMy mom said that the last 20 years were a waste and that she started thinking after our wedding. she said she is removing photographs of our family, and generally just disconnecting herself from 'family'. I told her that it is only fair to take turns and she agreed, but somehow still said that she's not surprised that I've hurt her once more.\n\nThe wedding - She maintains that she wasn't involved in the planning of our wedding reception and that his family was. It was in their home town, but it was also the place where my husband and I started dating and lived for 3 years. To make matters worse, I had about 10 family members and home town friends, while he had about 30-40 family members and hometown friends. So yes, it was very lop-sided. But in all honestly, I just planned the damn thing by myself. I am a loner (wonder where I get that from) and since my husband wasn't into the details, I just did all the planning myself - they had very little involvement as well. It was a destination wedding of sorts, so I couldn't actually meet any of the suppliers and it was all done online. I couldn't exactly take her to pick out the menu and cake with me when I did it all via emails. Additionally, my mom was also incredibly mad that I invited the sister that no longer talks to her.

I want the break to better myself and become more independent, but also because I've been developing feelings for someone else, but thats complicated as well. she doesn't feel the same way as i do with her, but i still think it'd be crappy to have feeling towards someone while i'm dating someone else, id say its pretty much cheating, and i know if someone i was committed to was doing that to me, id be pissed. plus the day i brought up the break to my boyfriend, this girl and i cuddled in my bed and talked about life and i felt like i was betraying him the whole time, i know i was, but i havent told him about it. i havent hung out with the girl since, but that doesnt mean i dont have feelings for her anymore. he started cutting himself again, but if i tell him this, he'll get worse.\nthere are other factors in the break, like how he has more than once said that he doesn't believe my sexuality (which is so hurtful and frusturating) and that he doesn't support all of my views as a feminist and an activist.\nin my eyes, you either stay together forever or break up. and right now im between the two, they're both terrifying. i know if i dont break up right now something will happen in the future thats more hurtful than this. i never want to cheat on him EVER. but i feel like thats what would happen if i tried to be with him and only him at this time in my life.

In 1984, she came to the states to pursue a better life for herself and her four younger brothers. When she came here, despite English not being her first language, managed to complete high school in 3 years. She did later attempt to attend college and managed to complete three semesters. However, college did not come without a hefty price. College was too expensive for her while she assisted her parents and her younger brothers in paying the bills. It was a luxury she simply couldn\u2019t afford.\nNot having a college degree in today\u2019s day and age can\u2019t get you far, as we all know. Before the time she enrolled, she was laid off. She figured getting a college degree would help her chances of finding a new job [she found one, but not as good as the last one.] We enrolled, at different colleges, around the same time\u2026.. And that\u2019s when the conflicts started. Like I said, English isn\u2019t her first language. She can speak and read it well enough, but god forbid she needs to write something down. So that\u2019s where I come in. And holy fuck, can the timing be bad. I has to constantly write her papers when I also had my own papers to write. It was tough, but she\u2019s my mom, so I sucked it up. Although, last semester she needed me to write her a 7 page essay that was due the same week as finals\u2019 week. (Required a lot of time consuming research). Granted, I did it. And I still managed to ace my courses. But my god, was I stressed and exhausted. That was a rough week. And I was kind of furious because it almost compromised my chances of passing my classes. I told her, after that week, that I can only help her so much now, since my courses are getting more and more difficult and I need to devote more time to them. She told me she understands, and will lessen the requests.\nFast forward to this week, I have two very big midterms. If I fuck up on these tests, I just literally wasted my entire semester. So I\u2019m in hardcore study mode. Fuck my friends, fuck my family, fuck my life. I NEED to pass these tests. And, of course, my mom has an essay due on the day of one of the tests. It\u2019s also a big part of her grade. Due to my situation, I simply flat-out said no. \nMe: \u201cMom, I really want to help you, I do. But I cannot afford to fail these tests.\u201d\nMom: \u201cPlease [Jonastty], I really need this too. Can\u2019t you squeeze it into your schedule? You\u2019re better at this than I am. It\u2019ll only take you a couple hours.\u201d\nMe: \u201cMom, these are hours I can\u2019t afford to waste. I want to help you, but I can\u2019t put my grades at risk. You\u2019re asking me to choose between my future and yours.\u201d\nSo, I didn\u2019t do it. I just refused to do her paper.\nMom: \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible son! I work my ass off to support you!\u201d [She does. It\u2019s just her and I. She\u2019s a single mom and one of the hardest working people I know. We struggle to get by, but we manage.] \u201cAnd you can\u2019t even do this for me?!\u201d\nMe: \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t do it. I need you to understand that I have my own things to do.\u201d\nShe angry, I\u2019m angry. We are all angry. We haven\u2019t spoken all day.

Let's say my name is Josh. Make it easy. I'm 16 for reference and a junior in high school.\n\nSo this happened tonight. I texted my friend - let's call him Nate - asking if he wanted to hang out. Sure, and he proposes that we go hang out with my ex - who we'll call Abby - and her friend - Jane works. I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\n\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\n\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\n\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\n\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\n\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\n\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\n\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\n\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\n\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \n\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\n\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\n\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left.

I am Tim and my friend is Bob.\n\n**Background Information:**\n\nOk so, if you're  not familiar with how Dota 2 works, basically what you need to know is that in the game, you have heroes that are played by the players and they gradually get better throughout the game by killing enemy heroes and other CPU controlled characters. Along with the leveling up of your base character, there are also items in the game that are bought with gold that you get from killing enemies that improve certain attributes like attack speed, damage, or movement speed. Most basic items increase attributes by small amounts like +5 or +10 and cost small/medium amounts of gold (from 1000-5000 gold usually). \n\nThere is an item in the game that costs 6200 called Divine Rapier that increases the users attack damage by +330. There is a catch though, if the user of the item is killed by an opponent, the item is dropped on the ground and is free to be picked up by anyone, including the enemy team. This item is very rarely bought because of the high risk associated with having an item that is so powerful, and can be lost so quickly.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\nSo in this particular game that we were playing, we were about 30 minutes into the game and we were winning by a lot. We were all higher levels and had way better items than the other team and we were snowballing towards a victory (in dota 2, if another team gets way out ahead of the other team, it's very hard to come back, almost impossible if the other team is overpowered enough). Our team was definitely at the point where it was a sure win as long as we didn't royally fuck up. Can you guess what happened? A fuck up is what happened. So my friend Bob gets it into his head that he needs some extra firepower so he decides to buy Divine Rapier (the 330 damage item) and we proceed to start wrecking the enemy team even harder than we were before. After getting a few kills, Bob dies and the item drops to the enemy team. Not good at all. Because the enemy team now had an item that could kill extremely quickly, the game started gradually moving back in to their favor because our team couldn't kill the guy who picked it up.\n\nEventually though, Tim ended up killing the guy who had the item and got it back for the team. Shortly after though, Tim died and the enemy team got the item back and proceeded to win the game. After the game Tim was salty and called Bob out for buying that item which ultimately resulted in us losing the game. An argument ensued and so now, Tim is asking for your help to decide who is right and who is wrong. Bob thinks that Tim was partially to blame and Tim thinks that it was entirely Bob's fault.\n\n\n**Bob's argument:**\n\nBob says that although it was partially his fault that we lost the game, Tim was also at fault because Tim died and gave the item back to the other team.\n\n**Tim's argument:**\n\nTim says that it wasn't his fault at all and that it was entirely Bob's fault because the item would have never been in the game if Bob didn't buy it and therefore, Tim would have never had the opportunity to lose the item back to the other team.\n\n**Who's argument is correct?** **Was it entirely Bob's fault?** **Or was Tim partially to blame as well?**\n\nI really need to know if I should be rubbing it in my friend's face that I'm right, or if I should be shamefully telling him that he was right all along.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this if you got all the way through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 0, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3unt7r", "name": "t3_3unt7r", "created_utc": 1448762664.0, "title": "AITA for losing the Thanksgiving Turkey?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3uoe65", "name": "t3_3uoe65", "created_utc": 1448772958.0, "title": "AITA for wanting my parents to kick me some money?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "comments": [{"id": "cxghvx6", "body": "Where are you getting $500 trees from", "link_id": "t3_3uoe65", "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3uoe65/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_kick_me_some_money/cxghvx6/", "score": 2, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"id": "cxgia08", "body": "Yes, your parents don't owe you an expensive camera because you want to pursue a career in film making.

Jessica and I started talking a lot and in early September we started dating. The relationship was pretty casual. We go to different schools so I would only get to see her on the weekends. Most of the time we would watch a movie or get food together. From what I could tell we were both pretty content with the direction the relationship was headed. \n\n*Before the story starts I want to lay out a few dates to prevent confusion:* \n\n**Finals Week**: November 2nd-6th\n\n**SAT and Jessica's birthday**: November 7th\n\nThe first week of November was a stressful one for me. I had to take 5 finals (trimester schedule) and the following Saturday I had the SAT (I'm a junior in high school). To add insult to injury that Saturday was also Jessica's birthday. Obviously I wanted to make it special for her but I knew I was going to be completely exhausted by the end of the week. \n\nFriday after school Jessica and I were texting back and forth trying to figure out plans for her birthday tomorrow. This was my first time taking the SAT so I told her I'd most likely be free around 1 in the afternoon. Jessica tells me that should work because the rest of the night she is going to the mall with friends and getting dinner with her family. I also text her wishing her a happy birthday and give her a heads up that we will play tomorrow by ear because I will most likely be to exhausted to hang out. That night I purposely get to bed early with the intention to be rested enough to hang out Jessica. The whole night I was tossing and turning because I was so anxious about the SAT and making the day special for Jessica. \n\nSaturday morning I'm up bright and early at 7 AM and head over to the testing center. I text Jessica one more time wishing her a happy birthday and that I will text her once I finish the test. Overall the SAT took about 5 hours with the breaks we got in between sections. The test officially ended at 12:50 PM and I was completely exhausted so I got in my car and drove home. At 1 PM as I was about to text Jessica she texts me asking what the plan is. I text her back telling her that I am way to tired to hang out with her and that I need to go home and take a nap. She seems a little disappointed (which is understandable) and I text her back that I'm super sorry and that we can do something special tomorrow (she was busy the rest of the day). Jessica wasn't agreeing to hang out on a different day and eventually she stops responding to my texts.\n\nLate Saturday night (like 11 PM) she texts me out of the blue asking if she can rant to me. I tell her yes and then she proceeds to write me a number of essays about how pissed off she is at me. She complains to me about how I \"blew her off on her birthday\" and that I \"was probably hanging out with other people anyways.\" She also goes off on me about how it didn't seem like I cared. The first time she texted me I responded saying how I am sorry and that if we hung out I feel like I wouldn't have been able to make the day special for her and stuff. She keeps texting me and isn't accepting my apology so eventually I stop saying I'm sorry and I try to explain my side to her. I genuinely didn't do anything except go home, put on the TV, and fall asleep after the SAT. She kept accusing me of not caring and I eventually just tell her we need to hang out tomorrow and work it out in person.\n\nSunday comes around (the day she was very adamant about being to busy to hang out on) and we go out and get food at Panera. The whole time it was kind of awkward and we were just making small talk. As I am driving her back to her house, I tell Jessica that we should probably break up. I explain to her that I really enjoy spending time with her but I don't think it's working out. She agrees and I tell her that I hope we can still be friends. She seemed very content with the situation and she didn't freak out or get mad at me. I thought we ended the relationship on pretty good terms and I thought I handled the situation pretty maturely.\n\nOn Thanksgiving I wake up and she a text on my phone from Jessica. She said: **\"Happy Thanksgiving!! So thankful we broke up omfg\"** \n\nAs soon as I read that text I got extremely pissed off and headed straight for the gym.

We've done card game development, game convention management, and hosted game servers. We've also done plenty of streaming and youtube.\n\nRecently, we've had a sharp drop in community size, as we no longer have any public projects retaining or bringing in new members. Wehosted a Teamspeak server for over a year, but recently switched to Discord.\n\nTeamspeak 3 and Discord are Voice over IP programs, used to communicate with each other, as well as leave plenty of space for community members to hang out and do whatever. The community is sort of split between a main group consisting of fans for streams and content, and my sub-group which is a slightly older gang of friends that have ended up here for one reason or another over the years. In our current state, I don't do much for the group besides moderate the Discord and deal with my own side business.\n\n**Here's the important Part:**\nRecently, I've had lots of trouble from one member of the main group. Spamming, posting NSFW content, ect. After warning him multiple times, he and three friends decided it would be funny to spam the hell out of the chat channels. In discord, chat channels are all public and you are by default notified of chat messages, which appear as desktop notifications. I got on and saw the absolute mess, with a few messages asking them to stop, no dice.\n\nI do my job and remove the main issue from the server permanantly. I then remove the other three for the remainder of the day. As I usually do, I left messages in the admin chat explaining that I had removed them.\n\nLater in the night owner (my boss) hopped on and told me off for eviscerating the remains of the community. I insist that without a community project, we can have a friendly community or retain all of our members. He gets passive aggressive about how he wants to work on the project that he's doing and tells me to go about my business (Clearly not happy with how I'm doing it.)\n\nThe move was a bold one. Those four function similar to me in my own group. By removing them, even temporarily it seems as though they've taken the entirety of their friends (a large chunk of our daily userbase) and gone off to start their own discord.\nThey don't provide us with anything, but if you work in this way you know that losing a community member means that they won't recruit for you. A large community draws people in on it's own and missing out on those guys is a possible future issue.\n\n\n**Was it the right decision to remove members for misconduct and hurt the company, or should I have let them continue like the boss wanted?**\n\n*If you have questions about this, please ask.

It was an extremely weird relationship because we never talked to each other before midnight and nobody saw us together. \"We\" did not exist. We randomly met one night and formed an emotional bond. We subsequently started hooking up but she wanted a relationship before sex and quite frankly I was not emotionally read for that so we just agreed to keep things low energy. I think she still wanted to hook up regardless of our relationship status because she kept pressuring for it at later points. She became way too demanding and one night she blew up at me when she came home from a break early and abruptly showed up to my room. I was way too fucked up to properly spend time with her and quite frankly all I wanted to do was play Project M, which is a mod for Super Smash Bros. I told her this and she then assaulted me verbally and left. \n\nOne of my friends came back two days later to pick up his controllers  and I guess he put two and two together. I never sleep with pillows and all of her pillows were on my bed so he deduced what had happened because he is friends with her roommate and spends quite a lot of time in their room. When I told him what had happened, he was unsurprisingly shocked and kind of insulted me. He told some people in our friends group and now they are giving me a ton of shit.

His wife is not stupid and can tell that he\u2019s lying but she trusts me enough that when I say that he\u2019s with me she believes it.

They went from meeting to engaged to pregnant to married in the space of about 2 months and every step of the way I was urging them to slow down.

At this point he admits that he\u2019s only around to help take care of the new born but will be leaving very soon. He\u2019ll still help take care of her and will seek split custody. \n\nOk so the other night he\u2019d gotten me to lie again that we were running an errand while he really went to see her again and \u201cTalk\u201d.

That I helped for this long why stop now? I told him that I do want him to be happy and I understand that the ex is who will do that but he\u2019s not going about this the right way.

This just happened.\n\nMy wife occasionally gets sad/down, and when that happens, she deactivates her facebook. Always a temporary delete, she always comes back.\n\nShe just reactivated it after about 8-10 days \"off.\" We see that two of our very close friends (another husband and wife, let's say Susie and Kevin) are no longer her friend on there. They don't show up in \"mutual\" when I look at her friends - nothing. She **definitely** did not unfriend them, we know that for a fact. \n\nToday Kevin, who also works with me, implied that my wife had unfriended and blocked them both. Nope, I told him, she just had her shit turned off for about a week or so. Well, fact - she was not friends with either him or Susie. (No idea if facebook would unfriend only some people during a deactivation, and if so, *those exact two people?*). It seems beyond coincidental. We find it hard to come to any other conclusion except that they must have both defriended her during the deactivation.\n\nWe presume that they both defriended her, but we can't prove this, and certainly wouldn't make the accusation. If they want to tell us that's what they did, fine. I don't really give a fuck about facebook, but I do very much give a fuck about people treating my wife fairly. \n\nConcurrent with all this, my wife sent Susie a text, and vice versa. Both show delivered on the other's phone, yet neither received the other's message. A double-drop, if you will. Between two iPhones.\n\nKevin seems to be certain that my wife blocked them both, and that she was intentionally not responding to text messages. He thinks that Apple's \"Delivered\" notification is gospel.\n\nI replied that I knew for certain my wife didn't block them, and explained her account deactivation, and that I didn't know what was up with the texts, but I'm sure a hug-fest could sort it out. He replied that Susie had a lot of pride and \"wouldn't be the first one to the peace table.\" \n\nI mean, wtf - isn't that *her* problem? Did I not explain myself/my wife's position? I feel like someone's facebook is their own and they can do what they want with it. He told me things like \"[my wife] should give a heads up if she's gonna do that [deactivate].\" and \"In the social media age, unfriending or blocking is like saying 'Fuck you' to someone's face.\"\n\nMaybe so (personally I disagree, it's fucking facebook), but regardless wouldn't some civil discussion amongst (presumably) close friends clear it right up, instead of this passive-agressive shit?

We have a recording studio which is mainly used by the audio engineering students, but is also available to film/video students for recording things like narration, [dialogue replacement](http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm), sound effects, etc. The studio consists of two separate rooms\u2015 a control room where the engineer works and a live room where the talent performs.\n\nThe rooms can be used together, with the engineer in the control room and the talent performing in the live room as in a real recording session. But the live room also contains it's own audio workstation for students working alone, or groups that don't want to use the control room for whatever reason.\n\nThe studio is available on a first come, first served basis, unless you've made a reservation with the equipment operator. In other words, you can use the studio without a reservation if no one's in there already, but you have to give it up if someone with a reservation shows up. Because you can record using just one room or with both, the rooms can be booked together or individually.\n\nRecently I went in the control room to copy a project off the computer that I had worked on earlier. I noticed a group in the live room using the separate audio workstation. I needed to record a narration for one of my final assignments and assumed that the group must have a reservation, so I asked the equipment operator when their reservation ended. Surprisingly, he told me they didn't have a reservation.\n\nWith no way of knowing when they'd be done, I decided to make the recording in one of the computer labs. Normally the lab used for audio work has a microphone stand lying around, but on this day it was missing and the equipment operator said the stands in the studio shouldn't be moved and he didn't know where I could get one. (Recording mics can't be handheld as they are extremely sensitive and the movement would generate noise in the recording.)\n\nWhen I passed by the studio I noticed the group had left to take a break, so I decided to try to do my recording real quick and try to finish it and leave before they came back. They returned just as I was about to start recording. I explained about the mic stand predicament and admitted I was hoping to have finished before they returned. I explained that I saved their project and hadn't moved any of their equipment and asked if it was OK for me to do it real quick. They told me they were pressed for time and might not be done for many more hours (not unusual for a final project).\n\nOne of them seemed irritated, but another told me it was fine to move the mic stand as long as I brought it back, so I grabbed my stuff and went back upstairs. I had to interrupt them twice more, once to grab my USB drive that I had forgotten, and once after I finished to return the stand I borrowed. I realized that getting their attention without actually interrupting them during a take would be a real conundrum since I couldn't hear what they were saying though the window.

At the time we talked about expectations a lot. I made it very clear that I do like cats (she has two) but that I want 0! responsibility for them and asked how well she takes care of them. Anna agreed to the first thing and said she takes really excellent care of her cats.\n\n                                                                                         \n\nSince then this stuff has happened:   \n\n\n\n\n\nCats have escaped on to the street a few times in beginning (dangerous) or up our big stairwell, had to lure/chase them back in many times.  \n\nCats peed on a neighbours' welcome mat, Anna bought them a new one but took her a while.\n\n\n\n\nTurns out the cats are a bit damaged since their first owner sucked. Not Anna's or cats' fault! But: We had all had quite a lot of nights where we slept like shit because the cats can be very loud and needy right outside my door. In the courtyard they also make quite some penetrating noise. Some of our neighbors love our cats but I am sure some are annoyed as hell by them or at least the noise and crap. We live in a large block with inner courtyard and many young people. At least one young couple with baby dislikes her (us?) now when they did say Hi and acted nice in the beginning. This is according to Anna. This couple happens to get the majority of the cat crap in front of their ground floor apartment since there is some earth there.. \n\nI have tried to put cats and cat litter box in closed kitchen only for the night, and when we do, 9 out of 10 times cats are chill and quiet and we sleep just fine. Anna has done this sometimes too but is a bit inconsistent, despite me asking if we could always do it since i need my sleep. She likes the cats to be able to walk in and out of her room and bed at night. But her open door is right! next to my closed one and the cats can be really noisy, our doors are not good.\n\nI have had to take care some of the cats now and then. Not a lot but more than I initially agreed. Anna likes to go out, sometimes she will stay out all night or come home very late and then the cats are very vocal, want their food. Have to wait on it 2 to 10 hours compared to their normal feeding time. So have fed them sometimes and cleaned catbox a few times. If this was the only issue i honestly would not mind, i would be flexible. Anna does me favours too sometimes.\n\nCats have crapped and peed dozens of time and sometimes puked in the courtyard (are allowed to go there). Most of that crap stayed there even though I talked about it with Anna. She picked up very little or none. Now, months after we discussed it (and we are both away on long term vacations) we get letter from landlord saying they have received various complaints from our neighbors. Landlord says if problem persist it might mean she can no longer have the cats.\n\nAt this moment Anna is far away on a vacation for some months. She left our other (temporary) housemate in charge of taking care of cats. Personally i think this guy is rather irresponsible and is very young, but yeh he lives there and who else can you ask to mind cats daily for months..? Anna knows I think him a bit irresponsible. He already replied over FB he does not think the catcrap needs to be picked up really since this is the first complaint/first time he heard about it and a neighbor already cleaned some crap for us..\n\nAnna is one of my very best friends! I love that girl but I do think sometimes she is waaaaay too easy going about stuff like the cats. With one or two things she does not respond to, or sees the problems she causes for others until there is a huge consequence and even then she sometimes does little. Like right now all she has suggested is we buy a spray that is intended to prevent cats from crapping in courtyard, does this work? Atm she has no solutions for the existing shit that is there ...\n\nHow do I get Anna to change and be way more attentive, regular and take better care of the cats without straining our friendship? Of course I have talked to her about this and 1 or 2 other responsibility type issues, but it almost never ends well. She will think I worry to much or am too demanding or become sad. \nCriticizing how someone takes care of their pets is often like telling a parent they need to raise their kids better,... does not get a great response generally, almost nobody thinks or admits they are not doing a good job. I prefer not to live being stressed about stuff that is not my responsibility or being seen as a dick by others, landlord and neighbors are not really aware they are not my cats.\n\nOr,.. am I the Asshole and expecting too much?

His biological dad, let\u2019s call him \u201cFrank\u201d, has no interest in him and only has visitation because HIS mother wanted to see her grandson so she hired a lawyer for \u201cFrank\u201d and now \u201cFrank\u201d sees \u201cMario\u201d every other weekend. Nearly every visit ends much sooner than the 48 hours it is supposed to, mainly because \u201cFrank\u201d \"has plans\". He was verbally and emotionally abusive to my wife when the two of them were a couple so now I do all the communicating with \u201cFrank\u201d so he can\u2019t hurt my wife.

He says, \u201c\u2019Frank\u2019 said I can\u2019t see it with you because I have to see it with him. I really don\u2019t want to see it anymore.\u201d After a little bit my son just busts out that he was excited to see it but after he was told that he couldn\u2019t see it with his mother and I and that he\u2019ll be in trouble with his bio-dad if he does he just lost all interest. The sadness in his voice was crushing.\n\n\nSkip to today. It\u2019d been bothering me and I couldn\u2019t contain it. I text his bio-dad and step-mom and ask if what my son said was true about \"Mario\" not being allowed to see the movie with his mother and I. I get a series of messages back about how I am an asshole for taking him to the movie \u201cafter they have had tickets for months and have been planning this \u2018Father/Son\u2019 bonding event\u201d. I NEVER said I was taking him. I very straightfowardly asked if \"Mario\" was threatened with a punishment and if he had been forbidden from going to see it with his mother and I. Once the profanity started and my question was still never answered I ended the texting conversation with, \u201cPlease do not ever cuss me. See you next week\u201d. \u201cFrank\u201d texts back, \u201cI'll do you one better. Stop texting or communicating with me. I'm his dad and \"Marie\" is his mom.

Roomie is old lady, alkie, copd with a fucked up knee, who has a shit ton of shit we are all moving into a house with. She has two big strapping sons however, who live nearby. BIG boys. This weekend was what she said (on thursday I believe) would be her day to \"start packing.\" When she talked about it on thursday, she said \"I\". She never asked me to help outright, otherwise I would've. I'm a giving person, but I don't like unexpected/unclear expectations. I've had a lot of stress lately personally, and I really didn't expect (should I have?) to help her out today. I do feel like an asshole for not planning it, but no specific demands were made. Not only that but were they made this morning in a clear manner, I would be more than welcome to. So here's the skinny on the \"fight\" that happened.\n\nSo her COPD wakes me up at 7 am which is fine, I was happy to sleep in. I get up, get some caffeine, and join her on the patio where she drinks her first glass of wine and her first cig. Now get this, I'm a self-centered busy little fuck or whatever, I had no idea at that hour in the morning what day it was or what her plans were. I completely forgot. My head was full of thoughts about work and other stresses, my weird ass dreams last night, and who was going to walk the dogs today. \n\nSo she first asks what my plans are. Thinking this is just small talk I say, something work related...and maybe something else. \n\nShe then says \"we need boxes.\" To which I reply completely non-defensively (I thought) \"well I don't need any, thanks.\" \n\nTo which she gets mad. She says \"well, we are moving together you know.\" \n\nAnd I say \"of course but who \"we\" I really don't like \"we\", if you want help from me can you please ask me to help exactly how you want.\"\n\nNow I'm self-diagnosed aspergers. I have a lot of the traits. I always tell people I miss cues and expectations a lot, its not from a lack of empathy. At this point in the conversation, again, I had no idea what day it was for her. As in I never made the connection she was expecting me to help, and certainly not how. \n\nWell get this then, she gets progressively more upset and demands I explain my needs to her more clearly. So I try, with my struggles with verbalization (one of my problems - I have no problem typing but words are hard especially under duress) that I dislike assumptions and absolutes, and that she doesn't have to force me to help her, and that it causes me anxiety when things are not clear. \n\nOnce I get this off my chest (and I thought she was just asking, not fighting with me, but then I realized the entire time I'm talking to her, she was pissed at me because I didn't remember or know she expected my help) she begins to wail and say \"that's it, I'm done with you, I don't  want anything more to do. I'm done talking\"\n\nSo I left.\n\nBut I came back to apologize, and say my anxiety was mine, and not hers. \n\nWell, she takes my apology, but her voice gets operatic again, and for me this is too much and I tell her I cannot handle \"escalating hysterics well' and I bug out. Not once did I raise my voice, and I realize that it wasn't good for me to use that word. But to me, that's how it was and for me it was a crisis. I had to get away. \n\nI hate apologizing then being verbally abused more, and this is what it was. My other roomie was still asleep and her voice was raising up higher and higher and I just run away. \n\nAnyway, though, here's the thing AITA for not remembering that she is a  sick tired old woman and I should've expected to be ready to help? AITA for saying \"please don't use we, if you want help ask?\"\n\nAITA for sticking to my needs and saying please don't use unclear terms when requesting help?\n\nAITA now? \n\nBecause it's getting dark and as far as I know, no packing has gotten done. And it really didn't dawn on me until now that she was expecting a major ton of help because of her knee and other things. \n\nI made the incorrect assumption, that since she bought the uhaul, she has the most shit, and mentioned her and her sons...that she would be getting started on the boxing up, especially since she said \"I\" over and over a few days ago. In fact, I remember now her saying \"I will get started in the garage\" \n\nI didn't offer help on thursday because I am a very cautious person. I don't like to be pushy. \n\nI offered help before though, earlier in the week, but like I said, I forgot. \n\nSince then , she accidentally sent a group text to me and my roomie \"fuck her\" (me) and that she is \"done\" with me. Even after I walked her dogs for her. (I do that most days.)\n\nShe's not my landlady. She's just my roomie btw. Help plz.\n\nBTW not once in the \"argument\" did she actually clarify for me what she wanted from me, besides a \"mentality shift.\" BTW, I do a lot of things for her, that I never get a return on, such as walking her dogs, taking her rent check to the bank for her, and taking the trash out every week, so for me there has never been a problem with a \"team\" mentality, I just like things to be clear and not hoodwinked and weird boundaries and shit. I've been a doormat before.\n\nEdit: Also there is nothing in the \"garage\" of mine except for an empty clothes rack. So when she said \"I'll get started on the garage this Saturday\" (on thursday) I assumed it was her getting started on her own shit, mostly knicknacks, paintings and books in storage there. I am a major self starter myself, and most people always expected me to get my own things taken care of. The only things I share with her, are some dishes a desk and a couch. The rest of the house is packed with her shit that I never touch. She is a bit of a hoarder tbh. I assumed whenever we get the uhaul, I will help her move whatever she wants me to lift. Although I am a girl, I can carry my weight, although her two boys who are over 6 feet are most likely going to do the heavy lifting.

My fondest Christmas memories have been getting things on the top of my list, even if they weren't at all expensive. On the other hand, gifts from aunts and uncles tended to be more expensive but less heartwarming, like a controller that I haven't used once in years, and duplicates of things I already have like MP3 players. I felt grateful that they spent so much money, but sad that I couldn't really enjoy it as much as they wanted to.\n\n\nI'm completely opposed to the idea that you're supposed to telepathically know what your SO wants for Christmas (or anyone, for that matter). It's especially hard since my girlfriend and I don't share very many hobbies: she's not a gamer, she already has all the music and movies that she wants (and her tastes are different than mine), she doesn't read for pleasure often, and she's already seen Star Wars. She's under the impression that it's supposed to be a surprise, and it's fine if I don't want it to be for me, but she wants it to be for her. I told her that I really, honestly didn't know what to get her, and jokingly said \"I might end up getting something you don't want, like a vacuum or a sexy maid outfit\". (She's totally into that kind of humor, she plays Cards Against Humanity and is fine with Holocaust jokes) She got sort of passive-aggressive mad, like she's not visibly upset but she was slightly colder to me for the rest of the day.\n\nIn the end I'm probably going to get her chocolate or a fancy date or something safe like that. I wouldn't actually follow through with it, and it was an obvious joke. But I haven't apologized, and I don't think I'm in the wrong for not wanting to gamble my money on something she may end up disliking.

I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\n\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\n\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\n\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\n\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\n\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\n\nI'm thinking of the following options: \n\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\n\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain.

After this turn, cars come to a complete stop at a toll gate, so I started braking going to the turn. The car that had been tailing me dodged in between a slower-moving vehicle and tried to cut me off, but failed to, again. I think this was dangerous, so I flashed my lights at them once they passed me after the turn and approaching the toll. I flashed them about 5 times.\n\nAfter the toll gate, I flashed them again, as a final fuck you.

Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \n\n\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \n\n\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \n\n\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\n\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\n\n\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\n\n\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \n\n\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 27, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3z0r82", "name": "t3_3z0r82", "created_utc": 1451659071.0, "title": "Don't want to visit my wife's family today - am I the asshole?!", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3z0saq", "name": "t3_3z0saq", "created_utc": 1451659740.0, "title": "AITA for not wanting to visit my wife's family today?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3z333o", "name": "t3_3z333o", "created_utc": 1451698668.0, "title": "AITA for arguing with a friend?", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "I'm a male senior in high school, I've known X for maybe three years, but I've only been fairly close to him for about a year.

I'm happy to oblige with info - seeing and feeling the support network around us is comforting. But I'm also a little skittish. I grew up in an abusive family, with an extremely intrusive mother (Borderline Personality Disorder), so I'm particular about invasions of my personal space and privacy. I was raised with a skewed perspective of what is \"normal\" - how much access I owe to whom - so I'm still learning where and how to place and reinforce boundaries. Which is where you good people come in. \n\nA good friend of mine, who is aware of my upbringing, pushed me a bit too far the other day. \n\nBit more background. We moved last week. We helped to renovate the new place and are fixing up the old. My doc has been expecting me to go into labor for the past three weeks, I've been having intermittent contractions every day, we've been on continuous baby alert, which is nerve-wracking and physically taxing. I haven't been able to walk or stand for more than a few minutes for the past three months because I have SPD (pregnancy-related loosening of the pelvic bones, fairly painful stuff). The holidays were underway. We have a big dog that needs daily exercise. My SO has really stepped up, he's worked his ass off to make all of this happen before baby comes - basically alone, since I've been sidelined by the pregnancy - while working a full time job. We're in good spirits, but a LOT has been going on.\n\nMy friend is a freelancer and just finished a big project. There's now a lull in her work schedule. Her boyfriend's family is visiting for the holidays from overseas. She's a bit bored and also looking to escape her in-laws every once in a while.\n\nSo. Day one of our (two-day) move, she texts me to complain about how everything is \"too much\" and how she just broke down crying because she's under so much pressure, having to work right up until her in-laws arrive. I don't answer, because I'm lying in bed, trying to breathe through contractions and postpone labor, all while my SO and two friends are taking down and reassembling our kitchen in the new place. The next day (our big moving day), she texts me again to ask how things are going. I am cooking lunch for a dozen people who showed up to help us out, so again I don't answer. She texts a third time, now in a panic, assuming I might me in labor. We're currently carrying all of our junk into the new place, so I don't see the text. She calls me, I don't see the call. She then calls my SO, who doesn't see the call. I finally discover that she's been trying to reach me and tell her that no, I'm not in labor, I've just been very busy. Because we're moving, which she is aware of. She texts that she's going to be checking in a lot the next few days. I say I probably won't be able to answer her if I'm in labor anyway. She says \"exactly, that way I'll know\". This creeps me out. I tell her she's sweet, but that she's applying too much pressure, and that I will let her know when things start going down. \n\nA few days later, on Christmas Eve, she texts me, wanting to exchange gifts. I tell her no, there's just too much going on, I'd like to meet up after we've finished setting up the new apartment, after the holidays. She says OK and backs off for a bit. Two days later (still officially the holidays here in Europe), she texts me again, saying she has some free time and wants to stop by. I answer, again, that there's too much stuff going on and clearly state that I will let her know when we're ready for visitors. Two more days go by. She texts again. Her boyfriend's family has left town, so now they're free to help out with the move if we need anything. I say, again, thanks but we're fine, we might need help painting in a week or two but we're good till then, and AGAIN, that *I* will approach *her* when we're ready for visitors and to exchange gifts. Two days go by. She texts again. She'll be in the neighborhood that afternoon and would like to come by to exchange gifts. I don't see the text message because I'm busy as f*** building furniture and, again, breathing through contractions. When she doesn't get a reply, she just shows up at our door, boyfriend and gifts in tow. I'm shocked and pissed, but polite, and invite them in for a chat. They do us a favor and take the dog for a walk, but that really just throws us off schedule, because they stay out longer than planned and want to open gifts afterwards - I can't start any new big tasks until they come back, so I lose a lot of valuable furniture building time. We exchange gifts. It's a bit strained, but OK. \n\nRight before they leave, she lets drop that when she couldn't reach me or my SO on moving day, she started researching what hospitals are in the vicinity of our apartment, and calling them to find out if I'm registered there, and if so, whether I've gone into labor. (She knows that I made an extra effort to register privately because I'm afraid my parents will do exactly this, then show up at the hospital and make a scene.) Then I snap. I tell her (politely, no rage, though SO says he could see I was seething) that this is not OK, that it's a sensitive time and that we need more space. While they're leaving, I give her a hug so she doesn't feel too bad. \n\nI'm not sure why she's so focused on my pregnancy and birth. When she's busy, she hardly pays attention - when she's not, she gets pretty intense. She has said a number of times that she wants to see how my body has changed in the last weeks of pregnancy. (I hate that. I am not a circus attraction.) She's commented a lot about how I haven't gained too much weight, how lucky that is and also how odd she finds that to be. She has always commented on how slim I am. So my best educated guess is that she was pushing to see me while still pregnant both out of boredom and out of some sort of morbid fascination with my body. But I do also think that she genuinely wants to support us however she can - it just has to be on her terms. Which is totally OK. I may have also been too nice during all of this? Not clear and direct enough? That may have caused some confusion for her.\n\nRelevant side story: She and her boyfriend were supposed to watch our dog when I go into labor. When I found out her in-laws were coming to visit right before my due date, I had to ask if they could still take on the dog if the baby comes while they're visiting. Her response was basically: \"Oh yeah, come to think of it, I guess not, haha! If you don't find anyone else, let me know, but we really don't have time after all.\" I hate to think what would have happened if I had gone into labor without clearing that up first. But - *also* - before the move, her boyfriend spent an entire afternoon helping us build a cupboard for the kitchen, and expected nothing in return, which was awesome. He has helped us numerous times before. We usually cook them a big fancy meal as a thank you.\n\nThat evening, after the forced visit, I text her an explanation - that I understand that she's emotionally involved, and that I'm glad I have her support, but that I am not comfortable with her behavior. That forcing a visit after being told numerous times that we did not want them stopping by meant she didn't respect out boundaries, and that it made me worry about what it could be like when the baby is here. Will she disregard our wishes then too? And that calling hospitals to find out where I'm registered is intrusive. I also told her that not every woman enjoys her body being viewed and evaluated in the last weeks of pregnancy, because it's a really awkward and uncomfortable time. I ended the text on a positive note, thanking her for her help and interest, but I was still pretty direct about the whole thing. She didn't react well, and said I'm being overly critical and hypersensitive, that I've deeply hurt her feelings and created distance between us, and that all of her previous pregnant girlfriends appreciated the effort she put in. Basically: That I'm the weird one.\n\nSo. Am I pushed her away for no reason? Was her behavior normal (especially calling the hospital)? Am I overreacting?

Throughout the years we naturally drifted away as we became part of different friend groups. Going into High School our friends were split up because we took different classes based on our educational goals. My friend \u201cJack\u201d and I had a couple classes together as well as with some of our mutual friends. I saw him every day so naturally we started to talk casually. Throughout  the years he introduced me to two of his friends, let\u2019s call them \u201cWill and Paul\u201d. Will, Paul, Jack, and I became pretty close friends often taking art classes together and sitting together at lunch. As high school came to an end Jack become more aggressively romantic. He would become extremely jealous if I sat next to my other guy-friends and even became aggravated at the thought of me hanging out with my boyfriend. He never directly spoke to me about his feelings, but I heard about it through mutual friends. Unfortunately I eventually broke up with my boyfriend and Jack took this opportunity to ask me to prom. I of course said yes but I specified that it would be as just friends. He agreed and promised to not make any moves on me. As a final hoorah, my friends Will, Paul, and \u201cCole\u201d decided to arrange a trip to a cabin Cole\u2019s family owned and it would be a weeklong trip with myself, Paul, Jack, Will, and Cole and his girlfriend in a cabin located eight hours out-of-state. \n\nAs prom came closer Jack began to talk about possibly telling me about his feelings for me publically at prom. Some friends decided to give me a heads up, as I am a very shy individual when it comes to that shit. The awkwardness that came from knowing about his feelings made me change the way I acted around him. I was not aware that his feelings for me were romantic and it became hard to act normal around him. We eventually decided to cancel the cabin trip, which angered Jack. I decided to still go to prom with him as I had already accepted, but I was not going to be alone with him if at all possible. Jack found out that I knew about his feelings for me and became enraged at Paul and Will for not letting him know that I knew. Two months went by where the awkwardness between Jack and I was so intense that we couldn\u2019t even talk to each other alone. High school ended and we all graduated and went our separate ways for six months. \nI got a Facebook message from Paul telling me that they were all hanging out at Will\u2019s house and wanted me to come along. I knew talking to Jack after not seeing for six months would be awkward but I missed my friends. We began to hang out regularly but it became obvious that Jack was not over being rejected. Paul, Will and I became closer but Jack became more volatile and began to call me \u201cslut, cunt, and bitch\u201d to whomever would listen. He eventually pissed off Will and he ended up kicking him out of our group. Hanging out without Jack was way more comfortable and relaxing. It worried me that I could toss aside such a long term friend without really feeling bad. It has been nine months since we kicked him out and he clearly is still not over being rejected as he often drops by to brag about what he\u2019s up and who he\u2019s with. Am I the asshole for kicking him out?  \n\n\nTL:DR - I grew up with a childhood friend and we slowly drifted away from one another. His romantic feelings grew for me but I had none for him.

I'm a Senior in college, set on graduating this coming spring. This incident took place in the fall semester (which just ended).\n\nOne of the final courses I had to take for my minor was Argumentation and Debate\u2014a topic which I both enjoy studying and practicing. The final was a tournament-style debate which awarded the victor and runner-up a grade of a 100%, with lower grades given to people who were knocked out quicker. Needles to say, there was an incentive to be the best. \n\nOne of the choices that needed to be made prior to the final was whether or not to disclose your topic to your competition, the benefit being that your opponent could study your topic and come up with some apt retorts. Now, the majority of my classmates chose one topic to study for the length of the class, as that's easier than having to study a new topic ever time we held a mock debate. Knowing this, I used the same topic for every mock debate except the final, thinking it would give me an edge. \n\nI showed up for the exam period well prepared, having throughly researched the topics I thought my opponents were going to have. The woman who sits next me, Aastha, greeted me as I walked into the classroom. \n\n(Some quick background on Aastha: she was also a senior, had the same minor as me, and constantly spoke of how she had \"stopped caring\" about everything college related because she was close to graduation.)\n\nAs I got situated, Aastha asked if I had received the email that she sent out to those who were debating that day. 'What email?' I inquired. Apparently she had sent an email out to make sure that everyone was going to debate topics they had been practicing the entire semester. \n\nNow, I have a VERY common name, John Smith, and there are a countless number of people who share a similar email to mine in my school's directory. I asked which email she sent it to, and\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014it was the wrong one. Happens all the time.\n\nI said it wasn't a big deal, I already knew most of the topics. She agreed, then followed up by saying she researched the topic I had been debating all semester and was \"ready for the battle.\" Then I told her I changed my topic. This visibly upset her (which Does make me feel a bit shitty). She demanded to know the new topic so that she could start researching it ASAP. I told her that I wasn't going to disclose it. She responded by shouting, \"THIS ISN'T A COMPETITION,\" to which I replied, if you think that's true, then you wont have a problem with me keeping my topic to myself. \n\nAt this point, I walked out of the room. I didn't feel like debating over the ethics of my choice, and I wasn't about to stand there and let her yell out me till class started. \n\nAs I left, I saw my professor (Prof. Hemingway) down the hall. He's a good guy. He and I have been friends since my freshman year. We chatted a bit, then headed inside the classroom. \n\nAs we walked through the door, I looked over to my seat (toward the front) and saw Aastha pulling stuff out of my backpack, looking through my papers. \n\nAastha is not my friend. I did not giver her permission to go through my things. This pissed me off.\n\nAnd in a strange coincidence, it pissed off my professor, too. He stopped her, asked her if she knew what she was doing, and she kind of smirked, put down my shit, and sat back in her seat. Prof. Hemingway gave me a 'wtf' look, I retuned it, shrugged, then sat down. We went through the debates, it was fine, I was runner up. Aastha got knocked out immediately (not by me).\n\nFollowing class, my professor pulled me aside to get the scope of what happened. I told him the exact story above, and he said that he was going to see what he could do. I figured he was going to bump ten point off her score or something. Then, the following day, I got an email saying that I was urgently needed at Dean Black's office, who runs the College of Arts and Science at my university. \n\nWhen I got there he and Prof. Hemingway had laid out several forms and looked as though they had been discussing the topic for hours. Then they laid out their opinion. \n\nYou see, my school is progressive in terms of the protection of property and privacy, and Aastha had made a big mistake. \n\nLong story short, they considered what she did not only a violation of privacy, but because I had chosen not to disclose my topic, they also considered her actions attempts at both cheating and harassing another student with the intention of aiding them in cheating. \n\nOver winter break, they took her to academic court on my behalf. Things did not turn out well for Aastha. I was forwarded the decision that the court came to. She was given a zero on the exam (but didn't fail the class), and she had my stripped of the right to walk at graduation. \n\nAnd that's where my story ends. I have a lot friends in the communication department. All of them know her. The group is split on whether or not I did the right thing in requesting that she be taken to academic court. The ones who think I overreacted now avoid me, which I get.\n\nI have mixed feelings as well.

I am so sorry this is so long. I don\u2019t want to give a half story. Sorry!\nBackground:\nShe (19F) and I (19M) had known each other since beginning of high school. We dated on and off. 1st time was sophomore year and it ended badly. Went on dates every weekend, did typical BF+GF stuff [;)], but she didn\u2019t want to advertise it at school. That\u2019s fine whatever. After 6 months my friend said he saw her with another guy at lunch. I confronted her about it and she said she didn\u2019t know her and I were in a relationship. Whatever. I moved on.\nSeveral months passed and we got together again. I made it \"official\" or whatever (dating is confusing) and we were fine. I get a text randomly out of the blue one day saying she wants to end it, but won't give me a reason. She had a 4th of July party the next night that I was still invited to, so I went. Saw her there with her new guy. Confronted her again and she said that he was her 1st love and wanted to see if he changed (Irony is a bitch), but didn\u2019t want to cheat on me. Needless to say I was pissed and we never spoke for 2 years I think? Fast forward to junior year. I left half way through the year to become home schooled. Got an email from her randomly apologizing for everything she's done to me, and wanting to reconnect. My thought process was \"She's matured a lot, I\u2019d be fine to give it another chance, but no plans on dating\". Well one thing lead to another and we ended up back in the saddle together.\nCollege:\n2.5 years was our last stretch. We went to the same college and lived together after our 1st year at the dorms. We fought here and there while at the dorms, a lot of which was her not being able to communicate to me at all. She couldn't tell me if something was wrong, what her opinions were on certain things, or make decisions on absolutely anything. Every argument I defused the best I could. We never had weeks of no talking or stupid passive aggressive shit, just arguments that resulted in her crying a lot for fear she would lose me.\nI did always communicate if there was something wrong between us. Mainly her inability to communicate, how she didn't seem to care about money, and she seemed to put herself first. I had to help her with everything regardless of what I was doing. I had to help her pack, get on her ass about getting ready to go, and had to help her study, but with very little reciprocation from her. Most things were defused but then we moved into together. Now she had brought one of her horse to college with her. I was against this from the start, but I never argued with her about it. Her animals are her responsibility, and I understand it\u2019s emotional. I was annoyed when she said she couldn\u2019t give up her horse because it means too much to her. I had quite a few pets but I found them all homes, because I know college is a large financial and time burden. It was hard but I did it.\nMoving in:\nWhen it came time to move into together I let her really find a place. She had to look for a place to house the horse on the property, because she just COULD NOT drive to her horse, and she would not budge on that fact. I helped with a large list of places, that horse boarding, but not knowing what was needed she had free reign. We ended up moving in to some duplexes on the same boarding facility as her horses (she had brought down another one of hers and her mini-horse).\nThat was hell. I found out she had no plans to get a job before moving into there and only got one out of luck at the boarding facility on site. She said she didn't have time, while I was working 2 jobs and other EC activities. We had to share a bedroom, and I was not happy. She had to have her massive waterbed (9ft by 4 ft) in a 10 ft by 10 ft room. She could have her things, but I was limited in what my things I could bring. I was technically not a resident there, the landlord was cool with us, but I was told if the city inspects it then I am not there. And on top of that we were 30 minutes away from the campus, with 1 vehicle (mine), and then she brought her dog with her that during the school year we would have to come back and check on twice a day. Our gas bill, with me driving to work alone was $300 monthly.\nSo shit got bad and we argued about the same stuff. She couldn't talk to me about anything, her still being absurdly dependent on me for everything and just general day to day bullshit. This was not 1 way either. I was told that I get frustrated easily and I curse a lot when I am mad. So I watched my words when I was upset, and tried not to be frustrated, but honestly it was just her bullshit that was making me mad. So it progressed and these fights kept progressing. Nothing breakup worthy by themselves, but all together it was a mess.\nThe Trip:\nThen the catalyst. I took a trip to big bend for 2 weeks at the end of summer. I actually convinced her not to go, because I knew she couldn't handle the hikes, I didn\u2019t want to hear the complaining, and I know she was going to be worried about the animals. I admit it was a slime ball thing to do, but I was thinking for myself. I didn\u2019t tell her those reasons but she agreed to it. Definitely an Asshole for that. but I digress.\nGot into a huuuuge fight the day before. I was still planning, packing etc. and we had to go home (3 hrs away) for a few days leading up to the trip. She HAD to see her family and whatnot. So I got what I could done and told her that we will just have to leave early on Sunday (trip left Monday at 6AM). Then it came. On Saturday she had a bitch fit at me because she NEVER gets to see her family and I wanted to go see my grandparents. We went home at least once a month and we both slept at her families house. I would see my family for 2-3 hours tops at a time. Then Sunday came around, and she was upset because I wanted to leave at 10AM to pack and get things ready, plus go to the stores. That was too early we fought and ended up leaving at 5PM. It was Sunday evening in the bible belt. Nothing was open when we rolled back into town after fighting for almost 3 hours. I just let it go not wanting to be mad at her before leaving on a trip. Next day we ride over there so she can drop me off. There was around a dozen other people there for the trip. She starts going off on the people I\u2019m going to hate on this trip. Rude, and wrong. I ended becoming really good friends with the ones she pointed out.\nOn the trip I did a lot of thinking. Only got 4 hours of sleep a night from this. Talked to a few unbiased patrons and came to the conclusion that I should end it before it hits a breaking point. Didn\u2019t want to end it on too bad terms. And she really was a good friend. Get back from the trip and that just escalates quickly. She pulled up and was pissed because I didn\u2019t run down and lift her up out of the truck and swing her around or something (her words not mine). I just got off of a 10 hour van ride and had pulled my shoulder on the trail. I explained but she was still pissed. She then got more pissed that I was waiting on someone. One of my new friends on the trip had forgotten her stuff, so I was waiting for her to come back. She did I brought it to her and hugged her goodbye. My SO believed that I was acting tired around her just so I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything, and I was suddenly energetic around my friend. We argued until 4AM. Next day I went out and found an apartment, and ended it with her that night. Had my bags packed up and I told her I wanted to end it before I end up hating her. 1st words out of her damn mouth were \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do\u201d. She cried and what not and then came all the bs. I was told I was emotionally manipulative, and unreasonable. I did this 5 days before school started again and that was apparently too much shit for her. I was told that I should have done this during school when classes had settled or during the winter break. I merely contested that I could not lie to someone for months about how I feel especially in relationship that was failing. I also contested that there is no good time for a breakup. I didn\u2019t bullshit, or mull around. I did what I thought was right.\nFew weeks ago we met up for coffee so I could get a few things I left. I apologized for how things ended and how I didn\u2019t want to fight as much. We had a lot of history together, that I don\u2019t think was wasted. She kept throwing in there the guys she was hanging around and how she kissed the bassist of LA GUNS. I don\u2019t know if I am over analyzing or she\u2019s trying to make me jealous. I\u2019m not a jealous type at all.\nNow this is a me rant, but she really did love me. She did everything in her power to make me happy, and she still is, in some weirdly disconnected way my best friend. I had a lot of fun with her in between the fights and I do miss a lot of things. Things were not 24/7 bad between us, it\u2019s just I saw that where it was going and didn\u2019t want to end up enemies. I just want to know am I the asshole here for crushing her heart and doing so right before school started?", "score": 11, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "3zxbxp", "name": "t3_3zxbxp", "created_utc": 1452198461.0, "title": "AMTA for causing my friend to see gruesome pictures?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3zxljo", "name": "t3_3zxljo", "created_utc": 1452201758.0, "title": "AITA for causing my friend to see gruesome pictures?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "3zymh6", "name": "t3_3zymh6", "created_utc": 1452215059.0, "title": "AITA for kissing my friend when I like someone else", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "comments": [{"id": "cyq8fy2", "body": "It never fails, anytime some high school kid writes one of these posts it just goes on and on.

He calls it ebonics.  The rest of us are caucasians.  He says things like \"I *brought* a dozen eggs at the store.\"  And it's obvious he means \"bought\", so anyone who tells him he should have said \"bought\" more than once is busting his balls because they want to be a grammar nazi.  Most people do this to him, but I don't.  But sometimes, he'll say something that is truly confusing, and I'll have to clarify.  The long story is below, but **TL;DR: he failed to clearly communicate something, and when I tried to clarify it, he got offended and stormed out, then blamed me later for not understanding, so I think he's an oversensitive asshole.  Does that make me the Asshole/Racist?**\n\nOne day, my boss, Mike, decides to try to sell his house.  Will knows a guy who runs a store down the street and wants to buy a house, so he suggests it, and brings the guy by to see it.  The boss isn't around, so the guy from up the street asks for a floorplan and says he wants to come back another day to look at the house.  Will calls the boss (who is now out of town), and the boss tells him to have the guy call his mobile phone, so they can discuss it.  At this point, Will tells me \"Mike wants me to have the guy call him, so I'm walking over there to tell him.  Can I have some floorplans to give him?\" I give him the plans and he goes.  \n\nWill comes back and hands me the business card for the potential buyer's store and a phone number and e-mail address written on a separate scrap paper.  He tells me the guy wasn't at his store so Will got the e-mail address from someone working there, and I need to e-mail the plans so he can see them today.  Then he said, \"He told him to call him\".  And I said \"Mike's already talked to him?\"  \"No\", Will says. \"He's gotta call\".  At this point, I have no idea what Will is trying to say, and Will seems annoyed that I already tried to clarify what he said once.  So I say \"If Mike hasn't spoken to him,  I don't understand what you mean by 'He told him to call him'.\"  Then, he says \"Nevermind, I'll do it myself.\" grabs the paper he just gave me, and begins to storm out.  (He doesn't have a scanner or the plan files, so he won't be able to do it himself.)  I tell him not to be so dramatic, because I'm happy to send the e-mail.  So he puts the paper with the e-mail address back down on my desk, and I ask what he means by \"He told him to call him.\" and he storms out, leaving the paper on my desk.  So, I sent an e-mail with the floorplans to the potential buyer saying, \"Will asked me to send you these plans for the house\".  \n\nA day later, no one has responded to the e-mail, or called the boss, and Will comes in to ask me why we didn't get a call.  Apparently, he never left any messages at the store.  He just got the phone number and e-mail address, and expected me to tell the guy to call our boss.  Apparently, this is what the phrase \"He told him to tell him to call\" was meant to convey to me.  I think he totally failed to communicate that, and when I tried to clarify what he was saying, he threw a hissyfit and left.

I was driving in the left lane to make a left hand turn at the next set lights and after turning this other driver has made his way though the traffic and is now tailgating me. I decide to change lanes to let him past and the moment he is past change lanes back and pull right up his ass (I don't make the best decisions at 5am).

(long)", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "Hello /r/AmITheAsshole, first time poster and lurker since a few days back. I recently got in a bit of a bind and I'd appreciate any input. I'm sorry for the extremely long post.\n\nSo, I live in a foster family together with another girl. We are both 17 and live upstairs, fairly secluded from the rest of the family, so it's pretty similar to a normal apartment since we do all the work upstairs ourselves. I've lived here for bout 6 months and she (let's call her Kate) has lived here for a year and 2 months, so I'm the newcomer, I guess. I'm relatively inept with women (have lived a very isolated life, because of problems I won't get into here) but I initiated conversation with Kate after the first week or so, since I didn't wanna live next to someone and never talk to them. We got along really well and ended up spending lots of time and doing practically everything together. Most people who saw us probably assumed we were a couple because of the way we interacted, like filling our texts to each other with hearts and kissy faces. We were really close, talked about literally everything. Even watched porn together a few times and casually commenting on the actors' performance.\n\nSo naturally I got a bit of a crush on her (no need to tell me dating roommates, and especially someone in your foster family, is bad) and forever alone-me decided to summon the courage to ask her out. I did, and while I was kind of disappointed in the rejection, I was expecting this (imo she's way out of my league) and completely understood. I have not brought it up since, out of respect.\n\nOne day I went to pick Kate up from school, and she made me wait around 20 minutes before finally coming over. Turns out she was talking to this guy (let's call him Tom) and they're alright friends but no one she'd actually hang out with (according to her), just someone who's somewhat alright to pass the time in school. I did ask Kate if she had any interest in him, to which she plainly said no and that she's not attracted to people like him (Tom's pretty dark skinned).\n\nAfter this I meet Tom a few times when picking Kate up and figure that to potentially make me less jealous (because I really don't want to be, I know I'm not entitled to be and it makes me feel really bad) I should talk to him a bit and get to know him. I find out Tom's a recent immigrant from some middle-eastern country and has only been here for just over a year, but can already speak our language well enough to be understood, which is pretty cool. I don't get super friendly with him but I can tell he's a good guy.\n\nKate occasionally tells me stories of her hanging out with Tom, some include: Once he brought her with him to where he lived, which was some shelter-esque arrangement with other immigrants living in rooms nearby. Tom hadn't prepared her for this at all and it frankly scared her when they were watching TV and suddenly around 10 immigrants appear in the doorway. Kate told me she never wanted to come with him home again.\n\nAnother time, according to Kate, our foster parents brought Tom to our house (almost) against her wishes. Kate didn't say anything as she has a hard time standing up for herself, and had to endure the day together with him. After Tom left, she told me she never wanted him at our house again.\n\nNow that the backstory's over and done with, let's get to the main incident... \n\nJust a few days ago, I went to the mall to buy winter clothes for a vacation I was leaving for the next day. I had to get up at 6:30 the next day (will be important later), and I'm very much not a morning person. When I came back, I expected it to be just me and Kate but apparently she had brought Tom home. I obviously remembered what she'd said about never bringing him home and how she doesn't really wanna be friends with him, but I held my tongue and figured whatever, she can do what she likes. I went upstairs and did some stuff on my computer, while hearing them downstairs clearly having a good time. \n\nTom was still around when it started getting pretty dark, so I texted Kate to ask if he's sleeping over. She said no. She also texted me asking \"what are you up to?\" to which I replied \"not much, you?\". No reply. This happened a few times during the evening. \n\nAround 8:30, they went up to her room and just a short while later, I hear noises that sound distinctly like fucking. I listen for a few minutes to really make sure that's what I'm hearing. They were only like 10 feet and a door away from me, and she made quite the piercing noises. I put my headphones on and play loud music to try and block it out as it's making me feel sick. \n\nAfter a little while, Tom exits the room, comes up to me and says \"I'm leaving, see ya\" like normal. I say goodbye to him and go back to my computer. Maybe 15 minutes later Kate also leaves the room and comes up to me and asks me why I'm not sleeping. Conversation went something like this:\n\nKate: Hey, why aren't you sleeping? Don't you have to get up early tomorrow?\nMe: Yeah, but I can't sleep.\nKate: Oh, why not? \nMe: Well, you were making quite the noise in there.\nKate: Did you try to sleep?\nMe: No, I'm pretty sure I couldn't sleep to that noise.\nKate: What noises?\nMe: I'm pretty sure you know.\nKate: We haven't really made noises. Besides, you kept me up until 5 AM yesterday when you were at the computer.\nMe: I'm sorry, but you didn't tell me or complain yesterday.\nKate: Well, you didn't complain either.\n\nAt this point I'm just baffled and shake my head and turn back to the computer. She leaves and doesn't talk to me for the rest of the evening.\n\nNow, a few days later, I'm on said vacation. I felt really shitty that whole night and couldn't sleep for shit, so I didn't feel well in the morning either. Since then, Kate has texted me once, late on the day I left, asking how I was doing and if I had done any skiing, complete with kissy faces and hearts and everything, seemingly pretending yesterday didn't happen. That was two days ago now and I have not replied. She's also sent me two snaps on Snapchat, which I have not viewed. \n\nThis is the longest time we've gone without talking since we met. I feel really hurt by her actions and any romantic feelings I may have had for her died the same moment I heard them fool around in her room. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. Part of me wants to never talk to her ever again, but I'm still going to be living with her, and I don't want to make hell for myself. I know I haven't given her a chance to explain anything but seeing as she hasn't acknowledged anything even happened, I haven't really wanted to hear her side. I've decided to not do anything rash until I get my mind together.\n\nWhat I want to know though, roughly summarized, is this:\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to her at all because I feel hurt and betrayed about this whole situation?

She stated that one of the reasons we should eat meat is because humans are designed to eat meat, which I declared to be a fallacious argument and stated that the reason we are designed to eat meat is because the human predecessors mainly lived off of eating meat. Of course we are naturally designed to eat it but it doesnt prevent us from eating vegan food. Especially because the reason we ate meat was because we as a species didnt start developing agriculture until around 10000 years ago. Then she tells me that I can't say that humans eating meat is wrong, the same way i can't say that moose's or shark's are wrong. This made me go batshit insane as humans eating meat is a behavioural pattern, not a species, and just because the laws of evolution happened to give us traits that favored a certain option, doesn't neccesarily mean we have to stick to it, especially if there is an option that could work better, in my eyes, but that is not relevant to this post. Then i made the comparison that *should* we treat women like the natural reproducers, with the main purpose of their existance being taking care of offspring and preparing meals, just because their biological traits lead to this being a soceital structure? This made her very upset and she told me that that is a social and cultural structure, not connected to biology whatsoever(among other things). So I am wondering, was I the one who took a step to far by in her eyes saying that women are made to take care of offspring and prepare meals, which indirectly prevents them from getting high paid, prestigious jobs or is she pulling a non sequitur?\nAka, am I or she the asshole?", "score": 31, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "40roc8", "name": "t3_40roc8", "created_utc": 1452685290.0, "title": "AITA for being scared and thinking that my husband doesn't make me a better person??", "link_flair_text": "advice seeker", "selftext": "Hi! First time post here! I was hoping after lurking I'd be posting or upvoting something good or funny, or putting positive things into the reddit world. But no, I'm here for advice now.\n\nI've been married a little over three years now. And have done some great things in that time. But lately I've been suspecting that my husband does not help me be a better person. \n\nWe argue, everyone does don't they? I know I can be emotional and can get worked up about things... but I kind of feel like he most often feels he is never at fault for starting an argument. \n\nRegardless of if he's insufferable - he's not the one who starts the argument so he's not the one who's in the wrong. \n\nFor example, last night we had been out drinking. So yes, booze is involved and impaired reason. On our way home I gave him specific instructions about the journey. Immediately his reply indicated he had completely ignored me and what I said. As these instances often occur, my patience with them is quite drawn so I was short with him. He proceeded to get aggressively defensive and continuously ask and push me for a response 'what did I do wrong' and then ignore what I have to say and continue asking and not listening to my response and going around and around in circles until I get upset. It will get to a point that he will physically block me on my way, tell me I'm crazy and then leave me distressed. \n\nThis is a pattern of our arguments and I'm sick of it and sick of his behaviour. He is quite self centered and doesn't go out of his way unless he benefits. He rarely thinks of other people first unless he benefits. I guess that's why he made me feel so special because he was benefiting from pursuing a relationship with me.\n\nTL:DR AMITA for thinking my husband is an asshole? \n\nI'm also asking is this kind of stuff in a relationship normal? I mean, he has his good points, but he is really really wearing my patience thin and I feel like he doesn't help me be a better person. \n\nLooking forward to the responses. \n\nEdit:\nWe weren't driving. We were cycling, it is a route I take daily and I was just pointing out busy intersections and better ways to get through (there are roadworks on the way and it is not very well marked for cyclists on the way). \n\n", "score": 15, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "40tta3", "name": "t3_40tta3", "created_utc": 1452715077.0, "title": "Because I don't date f.....", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "40tv5m", "name": "t3_40tv5m", "created_utc": 1452715711.0, "title": "AITA for my petty revenge.", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "comments": [{"id": "cyx4058", "body": "[deleted]", "link_id": "t3_40tv5m", "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/40tv5m/aita_for_my_petty_revenge/cyx4058/", "score": 45, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"id": "cyx6413", "body": "I understand your thought process, but two wrongs don't make a right.

Our personalities did not click, and we had a few minor squabbles over things like when the lights should be off. However, I felt that all of our problems were manageable and had not gone in expecting us to be friends, so I didn\u2019t care that she had a completely different personality and interests. About a month in, she told me that she could not stand living with me anymore because I \u201chad been mean since day one.\u201d When asked, in mediation, for examples of my \u201cmeanness\u201d she said that I only gave brief answers when she asked me questions, didn\u2019t initiate conversations, and didn\u2019t talk with her and her friends when we\u2019d eat meals together. She also mentioned an instance in which her mom had said something to me and didn\u2019t think I responded (I did \u2013 I am just very quiet and didn\u2019t answer until a few seconds later than I should have). She hadn\u2019t brought this to my attention previously.\n\nI am a very reticent person, have social anxiety, and am just generally awkward in social situations. I explained that I was shy and awkward before we moved in (we were given each other\u2019s contact information by the school), although I did not mention that I had social anxiety. Admittedly, I could have been clearer about my difficulties reading social cues. However, after she told me she was frustrated with how I was interacting with her, I told her I had anxiety as well. Her immediate reaction was to tell me that I was making excuses, that \u201cno one\u201d wanted to be around me, and that everyone on our floor was talking about how \u201cweird\u201d I was. She then said that she felt like I was sabotaging her chance of making friends because she was afraid that people would think she was \u201clike me\u201d just because we lived together, and because I wasn\u2019t comfortable with large groups of people in the room. I hadn\u2019t disliked her until she said this. I had just confessed something deeply personal and instead of showing any sympathy or acknowledging that I did not have negative intentions, she used that information to hurt me. \n\nI soon switched rooms because she made me so uncomfortable, and made my own group of friends. Initially, I didn\u2019t tell any of them what had happened between us because I knew how much it hurt when she brought up other people\u2019s opinions of me. However, a semester later, I heard her talking shit about me with her friends (one of them lived in the room next to me -- the walls were very thin, and she used my name, which is unique). Because of this, I shared what had happened with my closest friend, as it had brought up a ton of old insecurities that I had been working through for years in addition to the new ones our experience had caused. This was several months after I had moved out.\n\nA few weeks ago, over a year after this happened, she posted about me on our school\u2019s yik yak page. She identified the dorm we lived in and used details (such as when I moved out, our year, etc.) that would immediately identify me to anyone who lived on our floor. She said that, when we were living together, I spread rumors about her and watched her while she got dressed and slept. I did not talk about her to any of the people I associated with \u2013 I didn\u2019t even have friends at school at the time. The people I later became friends with her might have seemed \u201cmean\u201d to her because they are also very reserved people, but I had nothing to do with how they treated her. I didn\u2019t watch her while she got dressed, although I can recall one instance in which I was zoning out while she was changing, and she asked me to turn away. I didn\u2019t even know she was changing at the time, immediately complied, and made an effort never to look at her side of the room when I zoned out again. Similarly, I never watched her sleep, and have no idea why she thought that. I am considering responding to her, although not via yik yak, to clarify that I didn\u2019t go out of my way to hurt her.\n\nWas I the asshole in our rooming situation? Would I be an asshole if I confronted her privately about what she said about me?

You have to stack it in *just* the right way or my father will cause a shit storm. The result is the same: clean, non-broken dishes that are easy to remove from the dishwasher (and usually done in less loads too). He got pissed and called me all kind of obcenties. He refused to talk to me for 2 weeks, lol. (Note: I am currently 16F and my father is 48M). This is just one instance. For the most part I try my hardest to follow his insturdtions to the T. \n\nThe current situation is that my shower handle completely came off and you have to turn the water on by using a pair of pliers (I realize that it's weird, but we haven't had time to contact a plumber). My Dad told me he will start the shower for me at 8:00 pm every single night.\n\nHe changes the time how he sees fit, generally anywhere from 7:30 to 9:30. It has only once started at 8:00. I have shit to do during the day so I'm pretty much dead tired by the time 9:00 rolls around, since I have to wake up at 5:30.  \n\nIm waiting for my Dad to start the shower, and by 9:20 rolls around I said \"fuck it\" and started the shower myself. Nothing broke. Everything is completly fine. Water wasn't too hot to waste hot water, nothing happened out of the ordinary. It was a 10 minute shower. I learned after the fact that he thought it was a good time to take a nap. \n\nMy dad walks into my bedroom and here's the conversation:\n\n\"Alright ____, let's start the shower\"\n\n\"I already a showered, i just turned it on by myself\" \n\n\"....You fucking didn't\"\n\n\"...I did.\"\n\n\"You fucking bitch, don't ask for anything from me ever again\".\n\nThat's pretty much how it went. My family is **pissed** at me because now my Dad won't talk to anyone and is in a bad mood. I broke the rules but I think it was justified. I handled it responsibly, it's not like I broke the damn thing.\n\nI broke his rule and in his eyes I probably acted like a brat, I was a bit pissy when he was questioning me, so I probably did come off as having and additude. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?

With my plans for the future up in smoke, one thing led to another and I'm stuck in a low pay dead end job 50 miles from my friends and hometown. I'm treated like crap at the job, tried to talk to a manager but it's been made clear nothing can be done. \n\nBackstory covered. I've been feeling so stressed and down about every aspect of my life that I've been increasingly pessimistic and recently suicidal. One particular bad shift at work accompanied by angry texts from my father and dismissive messages from my friends led me to break down in tears on the way home from work. I stood at the edge of a busy road, cars rushing past seriously contemplating taking that one step into oncoming traffic and just ending it. I had Samaritans (the UK suicide helpline) ready to dial, everything became too much and I ended up just crying by the roadside for half an hour. Since then I'd say I've stabilized, but suicidal thoughts are still prevalent. \n\nI've mentioned it to my doctor, and I'm taking anti-depressants to try and help. But still, I've constantly been thinking that I'm an asshole for not talking to my friends and family about this. As far as they know, I'm moderately depressed and simply hate my job. If they believe different, they sure don't treat me like there's anything to worry about. I feel I should let them know, and be honest with them but at the same time I really don't want to make them worry that I'm going to off myself at every opportunity.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole for not telling my friends and family I'm suicidal?", "score": 29, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "41lwdf", "name": "t3_41lwdf", "created_utc": 1453162389.0, "title": "AITA for wanting my grandma's pets removed from my parents house", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "I am a college student, I live with my parents for the breaks.

My dad, being a good son, offered my grandma to stay by us for the time being while she sorts everything out. \n\nThese pets are all horrible.

My new neighbours, who are renting out the other side of the semi-detached (different landlords), have a large Dodge Ram truck that doesn't fit in their driveway which causes the truck to overhang onto my walkway to my front door. That irks me but I can easily go around it so I haven't bothered to bring it up. They also drive across my driveway to get to theirs. Again, that isn't the main problem just another thing to add to what mildly annoys me. I do understand that their vehicle is large, the wife is pregnant, and they have a toddler so parking in the driveway is a lot better for them than parking on the street where their car wouldn't obstruct my walkway.\n\n\nWhat I am most upset about is that they use my driveway for their friends to park when they visit. I don't have a car and rarely do my friends drive to my place but, to me, it feels like they're invading my space and using property I pay rent for as their own. When their friends aren't using it, they have their kids play there. Normally I would just ask them to not do that but I don't own the house and also have never spoken to them so I don't want our first interaction to be a complaint.\n\n\nIt wasn't them but one of their friends who used my driveway who loudly complained (I heard it clearly from inside the house) to his wife that my house was trashy. Admittedly, it did have a tonne of junk out front because other tenants in my house had just moved out that weekend and left the porch full of their garbage and old furniture. That pissed me off and made me decide I did not want anyone using the driveway if they were not living here/one of my guests. Again, I can see why they use the spot because we live on a busy street and their friends have young children as well.\n\n\nAm I the Asshole for not wanting my neighbours to feel entitled to space I rent but do not use? It is a massive convenience for them as they have young children and are pregnant. \n\nEDIT: just found out that the houses weren't designed to have driveways. That explains why they are so small and that the neighbours have a fire hydrant in front of their driveway and their curb doesn't dip in front (which is why they drive over my lot).

So I live in a townhouse community where there are no driveways but in front of every unit there are 2 parking spots which are reserved.

As the cars start to pile up, and space becomes limited, my neighbor feels its ok for her guests to line up the cars behind my cars blocking me in.  The 1st time I had this issue, I was getting ready to leave for a party and had to go knock on her door and wait for the owner of the car to decide to move it which took almost 10 minutes.  I was irritated! I own those spots and I dont feel that I should be inconvenienced to have to wait for the spot to clear for me to leave.  To make matters worse, after I pulled out of the spot they parked in my spot.  I didn't pay any mind to it but when I got home the car was still there so I had to once again wait 10 minutes for them to move it.\n\nI waited until the next time I saw her to speak with her about it.

I told her point blank \"Don't block my spot, I don't want my spot blocked\"  Once again argument escalated, cops were called and for the evening the issue was resolved.\n\nNow, we dont speak, and I look the the crazy neighbor that places cones behind my cars so no car can park there and block my spots.

The only thing that is appropriate to do as a friend in this situation is talk to the friend about it and keep it between you and her. It's dangerous to confront the boyfriend, you can make things worse for her by confronting him. Letting all kinds of other people know about her personal business is by definition an asshole move. You probably already figured all of this out, I'm just saying it so you can have another outsider perspective.\n\nIf people are curious about why you have tension with a friend, that's their problem and you can just say that you've had a disagreement, or even that you're worried about her. Nobody needs to know about the details. I've had a similar situation with a friend, we worked together at a movie theatre where everyone was always in everyone else's business. It was very difficult to keep my mouth shut, not only because I WANTED to talk about it, but because lots of people were confused why she and I were no longer attached at the hip. I only confided in a few people who already knew the situation to express my frustrations. Even that is gossiping, but sometimes things like this do weigh on us and we do need to express our own feelings. \n\nYou have mostly good intentions here and I believe that you were just trying to be a good friend, but you really went about it the wrong way.

The top comment says you are though, and I think that it's a good judgment of this situation based on your actions. \n\nI am glad you've apologized to her for shit talking. Shit talking is shitty that's why it's called that, because you're the one with shit in your mouth. I'm also glad you've remained friends, because you obviously care about her or you wouldn't have done any of this. A lot of friends would have ditched you over this and they wouldn't be wrong to do so. She's a very good friend to you for sticking by you after this.

There are four of us friends in this group so I'll call them Cole, Cam, and Samuel. (Fake names obviously)(and then myself)\n\n\nSo ever since elementary school I have been friends with a group of guys. Cole and Cam have been best friends practically since birth, and naturally they're closer to each other than they are with the rest of the group. Samuel considers Cam his best friend, but the feeling isn't reciprocated. \n\n\nOf our group of friends, my family is the most well off so we always paid for our group to do the fun stuff growing up. Throughout high school my parents would buy us tickets to NBA and NFL games, all kinds of concerts (including Lollapalooza twice), and steakhouses practically once a month. We did quite a bit.\n\n\nI am closest with Cole. Cam has been an asshole to me quite frequently. Instead of treating us like equals, Cole was his best friend so whenever he had money, they would do stuff together without Me and Samuel. He took Cole to the same stuff we always took everyone to including cruises, games, concerts, and set him up with girls for double dates. I was finally fed up with being treated as a 2nd class citizen and I ended my friendship with Cam. I should add that we're all currently freshmen in college. I told Cole how unfair Cam treated me, so he understood me ending the friendship within the last year. And I can't ask Cole to stop being friends with Cam, because he reaps the benefits. Fine with me, but I don't want to hangout with Cam.\n\n\nSo Cole claims that we're best friends and he treats me and Cam as equals. In my mind, that's fair. So my family still being well off, I still take Cole to steakhouses, games, concerts, events, and etc.\n\n\nSo two nights ago, Cole invites me to the house he just started renting. I was down, and I knew Cam would be there, but I didn't care too much. Well Cole cancels on me because Cam set him up with a double date because he just recently got out of a relationship. I told him I probably wasn't going to come anyway, because I didn't want to be driving to his house at midnight after his date was over when he lives an hour away from my college. He got pissed, but then claimed he was joking with me, as friends do.\n\n\nLast night Cole threw a party with many of our friends from high school attending. I wasn't invited by Cole, and I was really pissed. I texted him during the party and told him \"Thanks for the invite.\" He stated \"You blew me off yesterday.\" I told him that he said he wasn't going to be back anyway, but whatever because I'm used to it. By now I should mention this isn't the first time I haven't been invited to go with him and Cam and Samuel to a party. \n\n\nFrankly I want to end the friendship right now because I'm tired of giving them everything and not even getting true friendship in return. I might text him and tell him I'm done. Am I the asshole if I were to end it?

When I got into my friend's car and headed off to the grocery store, he was surprised to hear that my roommate was home, as they were supposed to meet to hang out and study that afternoon, but she hadn't answered his texts asking to confirm the details. He wanted to go in and ask her in person, but knowing my roommate (who was dressed in lounge clothes and would not have appreciated the unexpected company of men in our apartment, however brief), I said that that wasn't a good idea and he should just call her.

We became friends. We have a lot of mutual friends in common, including one guy I consider a good friend. However, after what this girl did, I have been avoiding her as well as anything involving hanging out with her.\n\nI started to develop feelings for her. She was flirting with me a lot. So, I asked her out. She said no, and that was fine by me. Of course I felt shitty, but we left it behind and continued hanging out.\n\nOne week after rejecting me, she began to act very romantic with me. She began holding my hand in public, telling me how much she enjoys being with me, cuddling with me, etc. So, I was a bit surprised by this and asked her if she changed her mind about the rejection. She told me \"I want to just be friends\" and that she had \"no idea\" what I meant by how she was flirting with me (even the hand holding). I told her to stop bullshitting and leading me on, and I haven't done anything with her since.\n\nThe part that I'm angry about is how she knew I had feelings for her, yet decided to act like she was interested in me (she also liked it when people mistook us for a couple). When I asked her about it, she told me she had no idea she was doing anything. To me, this just reeks of narcissism, selfishness, and a need to control others. I was fine after the initial rejection, but the fact she did this and tried to act like she did nothing wrong made it very hard for me to be able to trust her.\n\nMy friends agree with me that she was wrong. She has also since apologized to me. However, I don't want anything to do with her anymore. She still asks me to hang out and such, but I always make up an excuse.

He says I'm being too narrow-minded (not sure if this is the correct word in English). I disagree: to me, she's proven that she's willing to manipulate me. Again, I'm not angry at the rejection- I'm angry at the fact we're in our early 20's and she was playing games with me like a highschool kid.\n\nSo, am I being immature and dramatic over something petty?

My family works pretty hard to pay for it, my dad works and my mom gets freelance work when she can, but the whole family saves money as much as possible (driving a 1992 Saturn car and our 1997 volvo has been our biggest money saver) however its not like we don't get family time or anything like that, and life is pretty great financially. Despite this there is a pretty negative stereotype against people from my school for being stuckup, which admittedly is true for some people in the community. At the risk of sounding snooty I will say I am not one of these people. It also scares me to death to be profiled as a stuck up brat. This is where my story comes into play. Where I presume I made the decision (in my mind at least) between stuck up brat, or poor little boy scraping by. \n\nSo I was participating in a sporting event, when one of the parents of the opposing team (this was during a break session) asked me \n\n\"hey, how much does it cost to pay for that school of yours\"\n\nAs someone who rarely talks about money with anyone other than my parents, I was kind of surprised by the question.\n\nCopperflame: \"Sir it costs a lot, but its worth every penny, I love going to school here\"\n\nMan: \"Ya, but how much. does it cost.\" \n\nCopperflame: \"my family works really hard for me to go here\"\n\nMan: \"Ya, but how much. does it cost. Alot? I bet its alot. Tell us how much it costs.\"\n\nI was kind of annoyed at this point just because he really wanted me to be stuck up about it. So I decided it would be good if I lied about my current financial state to break the stereotype of stuck up rich kids at my school. \n\nCopperflame: \"look sir, I have work later to pay for this school.

Without doing much research (my bad, I know), I bought Beginner's Guide and played it all the way through in one sitting. I didn't NOT enjoy it--in fact, there were parts I found really compelling--and it was more than worth the $6 on Humble Bundle that I paid, but I felt there were some parts that I couldn't fully appreciate because a) I know so little about gaming and Wreden's personal life and b) I went into the game expecting the totally wrong thing (once again, my bad). I also by no means think it's a flawless game. However, my boyfriend is a huge, huge, HUGE game nerd. He designs them, he plays them, he reads about them. I knew that he would love it and be a lot more prepared to enjoy it than I, so I recommended it to him in part because of that, and in part because it's just the kind of game you want to talk to somebody about!\n\nFast forward to today. He's finished the game, and over text, we launch into a discussion, at first about our favorite parts. After a bit, the conversation shifts, and I move in to talking about a (imo) particularly heavy-handed metaphor that I didn't enjoy. My boyfriend happened to like said metaphor, and I made sure to acknowledge that I thought that was valid, but then I moved on into talking about how it connected to a different part that I also wasn't crazy about, yadda yadda yadda. I don't want to bore you with this part, but I can explain more if necessary in the comments.\n\nAt this point, I'm home from class, and we move to videochatting. As soon as the camera starts up, I can tell that something is wrong. He looked very upset, and I asked him if he was okay. He says no, and explains that Beginner's Guide was really important to him and he enjoyed it a lot, and that because it had become so personal to him, my argument had made him feel bad. I do a lot of media analysis for school, and it's one of my strengths, so he felt I was arguing its flaws very well, which was actually cheapening the game for him. He also felt that because I'm a strong writer and speaker, and he is less so, that he couldn't adequately argue against my position. He asked that we stop talking about it, which I did immediately and with an apology.\n\nHere's my dilemma. I do feel terrible about making him feel bad, and about partially ruining what was once a pure and great experience for him. I don't know who wouldn't feel awful. However, I don't actually think it's fair for him to be upset with me about my opinion. I wasn't callous in expressing it. The bulk of our conversation was over text, where I couldn't read his mood. And as soon as he told me to stop, I did.\n\nAITA has been really helpful for my boyfriend and me in the past--we often find our arguments are easily resolved with the help of a neutral third party--so I'd like to see what you have to say now. Am I the asshole? If not, should I express my feelings to him, or drop it out of respect for his request to not talk about it anymore? I just want to do the thing that's healthiest and fairest for the both of us.

From the start it was clear that the amount of care we take for our clothes during laundry differs (a lot). To sketch an image: I separate my clothes into whites and colours. Next to that I do a separate laundry for my towels and sheets. My GF does separate laundries for: white, black, blue and red&purple clothes. Besides that she also does separate washes for different kinds of fabric (which I understand). \n\nBecause our opinions differ in such a big way we agreed, at the start, that we each mainly do our own laundry. Only because she separate her clothes to such extent, she most of the time has a too tiny pile to really fill up the machine. So if needed she gets some of my dirty clothes and washes them too. We have never really talked about this, it sort of happened one time and I have never objected about it (why would I).\n\nNow to the conflict of today: Today she did her laundry and because she had too little dirty clothes she grabbed some pants and a sweater of mine. After the machine does it job she goes and hang up the clothes to dry. As I can hear her curse I check up on her to see if there's something wrong. I find out that there was a paper tissue still my sweater. So now all her clothes are covered with little pieces of paper. I tell her to not worry about it and just hang the clothes and if they are dry you can easily remove the pieces of paper, which is the thing I always do when it happens to me. Me thinking nothing of it went to continue working (I sometimes work at home). Later that day, I'm on my way out for a meeting but I notice her being all grumpy and shit, so I ask her if everything is okay. As a reply I get a rant about how I'm inconsiderate by not caring about her/mine clothes, that I should empty the pockets of dirty clothes and some other stuff about clothes and laundry. However because I had to go to that meeting I had to stop her rant, but we agreed to discuss this tomorrow (the earliest moment we will see eachother again). \n\nHowever it does make me wonder who is in the wrong.

With it, Pokemon Platinum and Emerald. He never used it anymore because he had a 3DS. We broke up around a year later, after we started at different colleges, and I never returned it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I still feel kind of guilty about this, but my current bf tells me I shouldn't. He believes that items left with exes are \"fair game,\" but I don't think I agree, especially since the items I left with him were much less valuable. So I set up a list of pros and cons to weigh but I'm still not sure I'm not an asshole. So I'm asking your help.\n\n**Yes, I am the asshole:**\n\n* **I have had opportunities to return it**. We live in the same town, so during summer and breaks I've had plenty of opportunities to return it. He doesn't even live that far from me and I could have just dropped it off in a box without even having to confront anyone. Also, I've hung out with a mutual friend twice since we've broken up (it got weird because she was still so close with him) and although I fully intentioned to give it to her, I totally forgot.\n\n* **It was always a loan, not a gift**. We always intentioned for me to give it back. It was never \"my\" DS, just his that he was loaning me. \n\n* **I don't need it anymore**. My best friend gave me her old DS Lite last Christmas and I bought my own Pokemon game so all I use it for now is to trade between games. Even so, I haven't played since like last Christmas.\n\n* **I brought it to Europe**. I'm studying abroad until July and brought both DS's with me. This just feels like a dick move.\n\n* *His sister. This one is iffy because I can't remember perfectly, but I think his sister used to use it to interact between her Animal Crossing games? (Wild World and New Leaf- she also had a 3DS. Or they shared it. Or she only used it for Wild World before the 3DS was released\u2026 can't remember). So that would be pretty shitty of me to keep it from her. She was such a sweetie and didn't do anything to deserve that.*\n\n* **I am smug**. He didn't treat me great, and the childishness of feeling smug about keeping his DS makes me feel like I'm being an asshole.\n\n**No, I'm not the asshole**\n\n* **He hasn't made an attempt to get it back**. He only mentioned it in passing when we first broke up, and has not tried to make any contact with me for any reason since.\nExact context, because I feel this is unclear. From the email he sent me when he finally \"accepted\" that I had broken up with him:\n\t\t\n*\"I've still got a few of your hats and scarves, and you have my DS, so I guess we'll see each other again to give back to each other things we still have.\"* We never did see each other again, and after this email neither of us attempted contact again.\n\n* **He was a shitty boyfriend/person**. He was very manipulative and controlling in subtle ways and was very good at making me feel guilty for things that were reasonable/beyond my control/not my fault. So it feels kind of justified. ^Maybe ^this ^should ^be ^in ^the ^\"yes\" ^list ^because ^that's ^so ^goddamn ^petty. *Note: sometimes I feel like not asking for it back is a way to continue to make me feel guilty for something I shouldn't have to, but I'm not sure if he's that devious.*\n\n* **He doesn't need it**. He has a 3DS, which he didn't use that much. Also, when we broke up it became very apparent that he had expected us to get married one day (we were 18\u2026 Jesus Christ\u2026) or at least continue the relationship for much much longer. Therefore he wasn't expecting it back for a while.\n\nLay it on me, am I the asshole or not? Should I get it back to him once I get home? (no matter what I'm not paying $40 to ship it to him from Europe lol). Do I deserve to rot in ex-gf/bf hell with my new SO?

John smokes with me very rarely (maybe like 2-3 times a month) and Sam doesn't smoke at all. He doesn't like it, but that stems more from him not liking the stereotype of stoners (I think, but this is info I've heard secondhand from John). \n\nAnyways, normally I smoke outside as to keep any smell from smoking out of the house. I bought a vaporizer to use inside sometimes since that only smells like burnt popcorn, but apparently Sam has said some things to John about it smelling a little bit sometimes, so I basically stopped using that altogether. However, it is now getting to the point where it's 20 degrees or so outside at night and that is the only time I smoke. I like to get all my work and stuff done during the day and then relax at night and watch a movie or something. \n\nRecently, I started closing myself in my room, putting a towel underneath the door, and then closing myself in the bathroom in my room and also putting a towel underneath that door. I light a candle and/or incense in my room, have the fan going in both my room and in the bathroom, and breath all the smoke out of the window in my bathroom. I also Febreze the bathroom after smoking. I feel like I'm doing about as much as I possibly can to keep the smell at the absolute minimum. \n\nNow Sam has never said anything about it to me in the past and we've lived together for 2 years now. Apparently, Sam has been sending some passive aggressive type texts to John saying that it smells like pot and this is pissing him off. John and I both haven't really talked/hung out with Sam in well over 4/5 months. He'll either hangout with just his girlfriend or just stay in his room. Sam seem's to be pissed at me for something and I'm finding it hard to believe it is just the smell because we have been best friends since 7th grade. \n\nJohn say's that he can sometimes smell the tiniest hint of it, but nothing particularly noticeable or offensive (his room is right next to Sam's room). Now I'm left with trying to figure out what to do. I'm pretty disappointed that this is a point of conflict, especially considering the lengths I'm going to keep Sam happy. I'm not ripping bongs in the living room or breathing smoke on every inch of the house, nor am I doing it all day. I pay more in rent than both my roommates, I pay all the utilities, and I handle all communications with our landlords. I feel like there need's to be some compromise other than sending me out into 20 degree weather just because Sam doesn't like the smell of pot.\n\nAm I being an asshole for having this position on the matter? The most frustrating part is that Sam won't say anything about it to me or communicate any grievances with me, he tends to be a very quiet person. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long story. I appreciate anything you all have to say and if I am the asshole in this situation, I'd be happy to know so I can better correct how I handle this. Thank you. \n\n**tl;dr**: It is getting really cold outside (20 degrees) so I've been smoking out of the window in my bathroom, in my room, while lighting candles to keep the smell to an absolute minimum. This is still irritating one of my roommates. \n--------\nedit: Just as a point of clarification, I learned about Sam's potential issue with the smell about 3 or 4 days prior to this posting.

I'm sorry if I haven't been active here before, I will in the future :-) I'm going to try and keep it short (did not succeed!) but objective.\n\nEdit: tl;dr? A friend of ours that used to work at our company (a caf\u00e9 and an online store) quit and sold goods to us. He didn't invoice us for a year. He was going to take over our caf\u00e9. We went out of business, he still hadn't invoiced us. He owed us 4000 USD, we had paid his rent for 3000 USD, there's inventory in the caf\u00e9 for at a minimum 1000 USD. We owe him 10.000 USD. I tried to settle somehow, he is just angry, refuses to speak to me and blames his slim chances of having any kind of a future on us. \n\nAll right, that was my attempt of making a very complicated story simple. If you, by any chance feel compelled to know more, here's the longer version:\n________________________________________________________\nA little background: me and my husband started a business a few years ago, a caf\u00e9 open during the summer and an internet store, and after a few months, a guy with interest in the niche we were in (name here: Peter) in started to work for us and we fast became friends. Peter was a nice man but very depressed.\n\nBecause we were just starting up we couldn't pay him a lot (edit:14 USD/ hour) so we made a deal, but a very vague one. Peter was going to work for us and work hard and we would give him a piece of our business. After a year or so we were tired of him not really doing his share (=normal working hours) and we had a talk. Peter said he had stopped doing his share because he knew he wasn't going to get a piece of the business and we all agreed that we all had communicated really badly. Because the summer season was coming, we said \"all right, let's put this discussion on hold for now and talk about it after the summer\". As if we had learned nothing at all from communicating badly, we both drew our own conclusions from the meeting: we thought Peter should keep on being just an employee because he was king of ineffective but that we'd talk about it after the summer, whereas Peter thought he was going to work his ass off to prove he was worthy of being a part of the company. And so he did. He worked hard during the summer and we didn't pay attention. \n\nCome winter, he's been sacking off for a while and I talk to him again. Peter gets really angry and we all agree that we've been bad at communicating (again). However, this time he wants to quit, we want to fire him but he also wants compensation for his overtime. This is fair (even though he was super inefficient for a long time after the summer). But Peter wants five months pay! That's 830 hours overtime and he's only worked with us for about a year and a half. When he says this, it's in an email, he says we should never pay people under the table (which we had done in the beginning) and that he cares about us and would not want to see us locked up in jail. \n\nIt's not the disguised threat that makes us agree, it's some kind of state of total forgiveness and spiritual surrender. So we paid him and stopped talking. \n\nDuring the several months we didn't talk, Peter started his own business, in the same niche, importing a brand that we already had started selling and became their head distributor in Sweden. So we had to go through him to buy their products all of the sudden. This pissed us off a while because we had talked to them about distrubution first but we quickly forgot about it. \n\nAfter almost a year, Peter wrote to me and said he missed me (we had been closer friends than him and my husband) and asked if we could see each other again. I was a bit hesitant but after a while we did start to hang out. \n\nAs I previously stated Peter suffers from depression and I quickly started caring a lot for him again, mothering instincts maybe. He was alone and had no children and he wanted a family so sometimes we wondered if he liked hanging around with us and our four kids or if it also made him sad. Anyhow, I crocheted a doll for him while he was really down, drove by and knocked on his door when nobody could get hold of him and we had long phone conversations. \n\nAt the same time we bought Peter's merchandise and he worked for our caf\u00e9 a little bit, as a chef (he's slow but makes great food) during the summer. \n________________________________________________________\n\nThat's the background. Now for the current state of affairs:\n\nOur business hadn't been going too well for quite some time. When Peter (edit tl:dr?: a friend who had been working with our company who now sold merchandise to us) invoiced us for his merchandise, I had so many other invoices to pay and I paid the people that were most vocal about it first. That meant that I was late paying him and apparently (we didn't know this) he lost his bank credit because of our late payments. And then he stopped invoicing us, yet continued to provide us with his merchandise. He invoiced us really, really slowly but I thought he did that with everyone (now I think he was slow with everyone but even more with us). \n\nIn the spring last year, I started telling Peter he had to start invoicing us. I was scared of him doing it all at once as we did owe him quite a bit of money. So maybe I acted that way when I told him to send us invoices. Maybe I said \"Oh, we're happy if you don't but please do\". \n\nCome summer and our internet business is doing really badly now so we decide we won't have time for the caf\u00e9 this year, we need to put all our focus on the internet part. We offer Peter to take care of the caf\u00e9. He gets all the revenues and pays all costs BUT we pay the rent. He says yes and my father, who's been working with him in the kitchen before, goes along with it. All costs for the caf\u00e9 are invoiced to us and then we invoice him (but not the rent). Also, he buys merchandise from us now, to sell in the caf\u00e9. I give him good prices and tell him he doesn't have to hurry in paying. \n\nI start telling Peter more often to invoice us now, because our accountant is mad about him not paying his invoices to us and I tell her, well that's because we owe him a lot of money, but there are no traces of us owing him money (= no invoices). \n\nDuring fall it becomes obvious we have to do something; our business is going down. We ask Peter if he wants to take over the caf\u00e9 and we all agree that he will start paying the rent by himself in September and that we will get the rental contract over to him as soon as we can. Which we do later in that fall but his contract starts in February.\n\nI tell him more and more often he should write invoices to us as we don't know where our company is going. But I also expressed optimism about the company because we thought we had found a way out.\n\nWe had a supplier (bopp) who was very interested in our company and offered to buy it. Bopp were going to buy it by talking to everyone that we owed money to and make them lower their debts. Then they would pay off our debts. They said it was important NOT to put the business into business failure because of legal aspects. \n\nBUT all of the sudden, after talking to some lawyers, Bopp decided they were going to buy our brand, our internet store and our stock but ask us to put the actual company into business failure. We didn't really have a choice, we couldn't save the company anyway, but it was also a relief. \n\nI told Peter a week or so later, after the fact (it took less than a week for us between knowing and actually handling in the paperwork) and cried a little and he gave me a hug. \n\nI tried to reach Peter after that but wasn't succeeding (very common for him, being depressed and all) so I drove to his house a few weeks later, asked him how he was doing and asked him how our situation had affected him. As one might imagine, when going out of business there are millions of thought, fears and concerns and yes, this was the first time I thought of Peter. He said it had hit him hard and that he had sent his invoices to the lawyers handling our case. I said I was sorry, I said I didn't want any of this to affect our friendship and I cried because I realized what we had done to him. I said that we'd do anything we could to help him and we hugged. He said he appreciated what I had said. I left and it felt like we still were friends and would work it out. \n\nThen, Peter completely blocked me out of his life. Didn't answer his phone nor messages on Facebook. After christmas I wrote him a message on FB saying all right, what can we do about what we owe you (about 10.000 dollars)? You owe us 4000 in invoices and 3000 in rent, there's inventory in the caf\u00e9 for about 1000 (actually worth much more, see below). Can we pay my father salary for the remaining 2000?\n\nNo answer. Phone, no answer. Finally went to his house this weekend and knocked, no answer. I heard music and opened the door, it was open so I yelled \"Hello\" and \"Peter\". No answer. I went to talk to the neighbor for a few minutes then went back. I saw his girlfriend in the window, smiled and waved at her (I didn't know they were dating, she's 17, he's 37 and she was a waitress at the caf\u00e9, sweet girl). She stared at me as you would when seeing your beloved's worst enemy. I knocked again, she turned away and called on him. Nobody let me in. \n\nI wrote to her that night on FB. Said I didn't want to try and make her change sides or anything but we've been trying hard to find a solution with him...\n\nShe didn't answer but Peter finally did. His letter was drenched in contempt. His points were that he was trying to help us and be nice when he didn't invoice us and never thought we would \"give him the finger\". He said we could've written over all the inventory on him before going out of business and we'd be even but we didn't have the decency to even contact him beforehand. He said we had clumsily lost all of his remaining money and now he had to take an expensive loan that he'd have to pay interest on for seven years to even be able to run the caf\u00e9 until the season starts and that he wasn't going to owe us anything for rent because the deal that he would pay the rent went out the window the moment we told him to f--- himself.\n\nThe inventory left in the caf\u00e9 is worth about 6000-7000 USD. Of course I have written and tried to convince him that he's wrong but that's not important. I have now sent a message saying \"we were going to leave you the inventory at the caf\u00e9 and we still are. Here's a list of what it is and how much it's worth. But. You need to admit this inventory and the caf\u00e9 is actually worth something. If you don't do that, we'll come and get it this weekend. And we will pay you the remaining 2000 USD when we can.\"\n\nAre we the assholes considering the following:\n\n-I don't think wis pride will allow him to reply \n-If we get the remaining inventory he won't have a base to start running the caf\u00e9 even if we do pay him cash eventually\n-He will probably fail due to this\n-He will be in debt for a long time with a worthless caf\u00e9, a long rental contract and no inventory to sell\n-And considering his depressed state he will have a hard time to get a job\n\nThank you for reading if you've made it this far.\n\n\n", "score": 17, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "434o5r", "name": "t3_434o5r", "created_utc": 1454006747.0, "title": "AITA for being pissed about driving someone home at 6am?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "This girl was doing homework at my apartment until pretty late.

[Update on \"occasionally smoking in my room\"]", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "Hey once again everyone, \n\nThis is an update to a previous thread I started the other day. [Please read over that thread if you're interested in the details](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/42yiut/aita_for_occasionally_smoking_pot_in_my_room/), otherwise here is the tl;dr from that thread: \n\n>**tl;dr**: It is getting really cold outside (20 degrees) so I've been smoking out of the window in my bathroom, in my room, while lighting candles to keep the smell to an absolute minimum. This is still irritating one of my roommates.\n\n*I made an edit in the original thread to point out that once I had learned about a potential issue with the smell, I stopped smoking inside the house altogether. My question was more in regards to me being an asshole for doing it inside at all, not if I was perpetuating it in light of the grievances although my wording regarding that was really poor.*\n\n**So here's the update**: When John had told me about this 3/4 days ago, we sat down together and discussed what we should do. I didn't put any of this in the original thread because it wasn't exactly pertinent, but now it is. As mentioned, Sam has been very difficult to talk to lately (always staying in his room, not hanging out with us). We constantly ask him if he'd like to go to the gym with us, watch a show, get food, etc. \n\nAnyways, John and I decided the best course of action would be to have a night where all 3 of us just watch a movie, drink a few beers, hang out, and then discuss with each other what is bothering each of us and what we can do to fix things. We thought that Thursday night would work best for everyone, so John talked to Sam about this. This was suggested to him on Monday. John informed me that Sam said he could do that/would be down for that or some other variation along those lines. \n\nAlong comes Thursday (today) and as it is approaching nighttime we notice Sam's car is gone and neither of us know where he is. John texted him to inquire and Sam said that \"we would have to rearrange\" since he went home (his parents). He didn't provide any reasoning for going home and I can't recall a time he has gone home during the week in the 2 years we've all lived together. \n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed about this? Like, we've gone out of our way to get him to communicate with us and hangout and even setting a specific date to talk about our issues, which seems asinine in an of itself, but he decides to go home? \n\nHow am I supposed to deal with what's bothering him if he goes out of his way to not talk about it? It doesn't seem fair to me to change my habits/what I want to do in my room, based on something Sam has mentioned to John, but refuses to discuss. What am I supposed to do with that? We have thrown the ball in his court many times and it just never gets returned.\n\nI guess what I'm ultimately asking is this: Should I be pissed at him or does that make me an asshole? Smoking in the house again (with the same precautions mind you) would probably be a dick thing to do, but I'm failing to see the justification for not doing so if Sam will not talk about the issue with me. He's not a child, he's an adult and we hand delivered him an opportunity to talk about it, but he turned it down. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this as well as the prior posting too if you're a particularly dedicated and helpful individual. I really appreciated the responses in the previous thread and I'm curious to see what's recommended here. Thanks. \n\n**tl;dr**: John (roommate) and I thought of a time we could all sit down and talk with each other about what's bothering us. Sam (other roommate) agrees early in the week and then goes to his parents the night of the planned time. I'm pissed.

Now, I'm basically out of it (it would've been short, but was drawn out by a series of relapses) and I've realized something. \n\nIn the midst of getting closer to all my friends, I started losing one of my closer ones. This friend of mine has been going through some rough stuff too, so I tried to give him attention, but he messaged me or called me every day during withdrawal to complain about something different. Whether it was something he could've avoided if he just listened to my advice, or something from his past, or anything. He was always complaining, always negative, always bitching to me.\n\nNow, to the actual situation: I could not bare to deal with that during withdrawal. I had given him my full support before, way more than he had given me, but during withdrawal I couldn't do that. For years I had given (let's call him Nero for now) Nero my full support, thick and thin, through rough times and easy times, but for once, I couldn't do it. \n\nNone of my other friends had a problem with me suddenly being kinda needy. I just needy positivity, and at some points, a hand to hold. And during night time, I had no one to help me cope. It was me, my panic attacks, and hopefully white noise, a documentary or something to keep me sane. But Nero gave me none of this. He offered his full support, but when it came to receiving his support, he eventually made it about himself and his poetry or becoming a poet (which wasn't all that good, but I never had the heart to tell him that.)\n\nEventually it got to the point where I couldn't go 10 hours without sending him a message without him getting upset, or even worse, telling me he felt like hurting himself. It was definitely not what I needed, but at the same time, I didn't want to desert him all together, because he was going through things. I knew if I told him anything straight up, he'd threaten to hurt, or even worse, kill himself. \n\nBasically, I ended up in a limbo; talking to everyone but him to keep my spirits decent but in the process ignoring a closer friend. I felt like he was weighing me down and stressing me out more, and the more stress I had, the more panic and relapse I was susceptible to. I feel really guilty. They say addiction can tear your relationships apart, but I've grown so close to everyone but him. I'm not sure if I'm just being a dick or if I realized he isn't as good as I cracked him up to be. Tell me, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nAlso, please spare me the \"drugs are bad\" lesson. The drugs themselves have taught me that well enough by now.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a grammar error ", "score": 21, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "43ju52", "name": "t3_43ju52", "created_utc": 1454260058.0, "title": "AITA for inviting two friends who hate each other to the same convention?", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "Okay so let me preface this with a bit of history. My two greatest friends, who i'll name S and I, both hate each other. We used to be pretty close between the three of us, we all have Aspergers Syndrome and a lot of shared interests, and adventured around a fair bit. I only know I in real life, having met S online, but we had lots of online adventures too. Eventually, though, something happened and S and I grew apart. Fast. They hate each other now, or rather I hates S, it's not reciprocated. I doesn't want to be in the same COUNTRY as S if he can avoid it, and has made this clear many times. (It's worth noting now that S seems to garner hatred from a lot of my friends. I've heard him called a \"Dark triad personality\" in all seriousness, which is calling him a psychopath essentially. I'm, uh, not sure why, he seems cool so far as i can tell XD)\n\nAnyway, about a year after the two decided they hate each other, i get invited to a LARP convention. The guy running it is a friend of the family and i've never tried LARP before, so i decide i want to go with a few friends. I invite my two closest, S and I, thinking it'd be a good chance to meet S for the first time. I make it PERFECTLY clear that both are going to be there, and whilst S is cool with this, I FREAKS THE HELL OUT. He wants to know why i'm inviting S, and how dare i want to go to this LARP with S but not with him. He ignores the fact that i want to go with BOTH my closest friends, and maybe try to mend fences between them. At this point I seems to go quiet and leaves. The next day i find out some conversation has been going on behind my back and now neither S nor I are coming. \n\nSo am i the asshole here, Reddit?

I'm in college and my roommate I got along pretty well, at least I thought so, and we were/are friends. I don't think were like super close friends but I feel like we were/are friends. So now on to the actual story. For the purposes of this story lets call my roommate John. \n\nAbout a week ago my roommate (John) was kicked completely out of the dorms at my school. John and another friend (lets call him Brian) were involved in a situation that got them kicked off campus, totally unrelated to this story though. So yesterday John and Brian moved into a new place off campus and they invited a bunch of other friends (who I consider friends too) over to help them move in and had a little housewarming party and stuff. I wasn't explicitly invited but I texted John about it and asked him whether I could come and he never replied. He had just texted me less than 5 minutes before... Do they not want me there or do they just not care enough to invite me? Am I the asshole for being pissed about them not inviting me?  Was I wrong to assume they would invite me? Should I have just gone with my suitemate who was going even though they did not specifically invite me? \n\nEDIT: \nUpdate: John and Brian are having a superbowl party tonight. I thought I might just tag along with my suitemate, see their new place, say hi, whatever. Texted my suitemate and he said he couldn't take me because he was going straight there from where he was. He just stopped by to grab some stuff. He was here for 10 minutes and got some stuff and got my other suitemate. I walked in and said hi, asked if they were going to the superbowl party, to which they said yes, then stood there awkwardly and then went back to my room. They just left, now it seems to me the my ex-roommate specifically doesn't want me there. I think i'm just talking the whole thing up in my head and jumping to conclusions but i'm not sure.

Her coworker was moving out of his flat and he'd show us around.\n\nHe is a very nice guy and I think he liked us, too, because he told his brother, who owns the flat, that we seem like nice and responsible people.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. The flat he was moving into already had a kitchen installed, meaning he couldn't take his old one with him, so he asked if we'd buy it off him. It's about two years old and he'd paid 4000\u20ac for it. He told us his price was a negotiable 3000\u20ac, which is far too much for us, but we agreed to negotiate a price for it, should his brother let us sign the lease.\n\nTo our surprise, we actually got the flat. The landlord told us he didn't care if we bought his brother's kitchen or not. When it came to negotiating a price, we could only get it down to 2000\u20ac, though. Still too much for us, especially since you can get small kitchens for like 800.\n\nWe told him we'd buy one ourselves, while he put his on ebay for 2800. We did, in fact, buy a nice kitchen for 800.\n\nAbout 10 days before moving out, I got a text from the guy, saying nobody will buy his kitchen and he'd sell it to us for 1500\u20ac.\n\nI responded that we'd already bought one, and cancelling the order will cost us a quarter of the retail price as compensation for the store, so 200\u20ac.\nShould we take his kitchen instead, we'd only make a profit if he'd sell it to us for 600. We were, however, feeling a bit sorry for him so we made the offer to buy his for 1000, effectively costing us 1200 because of the compensation.\n\nHe said he'd think about it.\n\nThe next day he sent me a text saying his parents think 1000\u20ac is not enough, so they'll buy it themselves and leave it in the flat, letting us use it.\n\nIn the end, we only had to pay the compensation for the store. \nWhile initially I was quite pleased with my negotiating skills (From 3000 down to 200), I was (and am still) not sure if I am the asshole here.\n\nFriends and family say it's his fault for being too greedy. They might be biased though, obviously. \n\nIf it helps my cause, I'd want to add that after living in the flat for a while, it became clear that the kitchen isn't really worth the 4000 he'd paid for it. The appliances are very loud, for example, and there are other minor faults here and there.\n\nStill, this has been bugging me for months: AITA?", "score": 25, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "44ra34", "name": "t3_44ra34", "created_utc": 1454944059.0, "title": "AITA in this comment that the OP deleted?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/wJcTQRK\n\nOn Facebook, one of my friends posted that ^ status and I commented on that post (comment is in the screenshot).

I have some mental illness and as a result I have a bit of a victim complex. I hashed this out with my fianc\u00e9 many times, at first he said its no big deal, now after hearing the same story many times he says he sees why I'm upset. But Id like some fresh perspective.\n\n\nSo there's this girl I work with, let's call her Sue. Sue is a friend of mine, we actually hang out outside of work, we talk at great lengths about personal matters. I've known her for years. She has been with her boyfriend for 6-7 years, they lived together at Sue's parents up until about a year ago when they got a place of their own. For a great deal of their relationship, he did not work, just generally a deadbeat.\n\nI have been with my partner relatively shorter, we have been together around 2 and a half years. Our relationship was rocky at the start, and had quite a few on-and-off hiccups (again- mental illness). I got the help I needed and completed therapy, he worked through his issues, and things were good for awhile, so this past summer we moved in together. In December he proposed. (Yay!)\n\nNow, as excited as I was that he got down on one knee and gave me jewelry, it wasn't really a \"surprise.\" We had been talking marriage for the last year, and around the time we moved in together, we began making plans. We wanted something small- either just going away and eloping, or a courthouse ceremony with our family. We (well, I) decided it would be nice to have more family there, so we wanted to put the wedding on the back burner until we have the funds, and I told him I might like a ring. And he got me a ring! \n\nNow Sue was very unsupportive of the \"eloping\" idea. She kept insisting it was too soon, and we needed to wait to get to know each other better. And I could see where she was coming from, as in the start of our relationship, I vented to her a great deal about what a jerk he was. But that was years ago, and I think friends should let you vent about being frustrated at your boyfriend and then still be happy for you when you say you're getting married! But I can see where she was coming from, I guess.\n\nMy family was much more excited about the proposal than they were when I told them \"we're probably going to have a courthouse wedding in a few months.\" I think it felt more \"real\" to them. And to be honest it did to me too, for silly reasons I guess, but it did.\nSue was not excited for me at all and this is the part that upset me. The day after he proposed, I came into work and was showing off my ring, everyone was doing the obligatory \"oo-ing\" and \"ah-ing\" and \"OMG it's so sparkly!\" And I joked that I was nervous to wear it to work because it might snag on something (we work with our hands a lot). Which is when Sue launched into great detail about how when she has a ring, she's going to wear it to work for the first week, and then maybe wear it on days we do certain activities at work, and not others, etc. \nIt kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I get that she was trying to stay relevant to the conversation, but for once in my life the conversation was just about me. :( I'm not the kind of person who likes the spotlight, I didn't even tell half of the people I work with that I got engaged- I just waited for them to find out. But this really was a big exciting moment for me, and I just wanted my friends to be happy for me, not start talking about them.\n\nShe asked me literally nothing about wedding plans (she's like Pinterest obsessed, into that kind of shit), still hasn't to this day, and honestly it hurt because she is my friend and she just didn't give a shit.\n\nLater that same night, she brought up how she was going to a wedding the upcoming weekend and it was a private ceremony, and I asked what the was all about (never heard of that) and she gave me details of who the people were, and what she was wearing, and how the ceremony and reception were set up. I said \"that sounds really cool.. [partner] and I could do something like that. We don't want everyone there for the ceremony, that's not the fun part\" and she just disregarded everything I said, and said \"yeah I don't know what [sue's boyfriend] and I are going to do yet.... I have so many ideas\" and then went on to tell me all her ideas.\n\n\nNow I'm not saying nobody but me can talk about weddings because IM THE BRIDE BITCHES. I get that she's very bitter that they've been together so long and he still hasn't proposed (she is constantly talking about how \"she better have a ring on her finger by spring\" and \"it's been 7 years I am planning a wedding as soon as I get that ring on my finger\"- in response to me waiting until my partner is finished school). But I feel like it's really shitty that she couldn't put her bitterness aside for ONE DAY, honestly the day I told everyone at work my happy news, the day I was trying to share MY news and MY plans with my friends, she couldn't not talk about herself and make it all about her.\n\n\nAm I the (overly sensitive) asshole here? :(", "score": 18, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "45278h", "name": "t3_45278h", "created_utc": 1455102352.0, "title": "AITA for how I acted in this?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "Hi again!

No one has any time for a puppy.\n\nBut in the end they did it, and it's their choice. We tried to warn them.\n\nSo the thing about Leo the Puppy is that we have to take him to pee every three hours, even during night. At first I did it, because my mom and stepdad went on vacation the day after we got Leo. (I was supposed to be paid, but instead I got a screaming match. That's a different story however.)\n\nThey come back, and now my mom takes over Leo, because my stepdad can't. We're all fine and dandy, I babysit him sometimes, he's cute.\n\nThen my mom decides to move his crate to downstairs in the garage. It's easier for her, my stepdad and my brother to get it, but I'm upstairs with my dog (with separation issues), so it's a bit of a trip. \n\nThen my mom snaps.\n\nNow she starts texting us rapidly while we're in school, going on about how she hates Leo and she can't do it and we need to take a few shifts each (suggesting times such as 9pm, midnight and 3am).\n\nI was perfectly okay with a couple shifts, if she moved the crate back upstairs. I could do the 6am shift for her so she could sleep and I could let him out and still eat breakfast. We have a door upstairs to the deck and he can walk down to the place we normally let him out.\n\nMy mom did not want to move the crate again. She called me selfish, and told me if I didn't do it she'd shut my phone off.\n\nI told her again- I can't do the 6am shift if he's downstairs, and still have time to eat breakfast. I don't have much time in the morning- I get up at 5, walk my own dog, and have a quick bite to eat before the bus gets here. If I handle Leo, I can't eat, or my dog can't get exercise.\n\nShe shut my phone off, calling me an ungrateful brat.\n\nIn the end, I had to take the shift after school during when I normally walk my own dog, but now I have to let him out with her.

This is also about the time that the elderly start their day. It's nice that they're trying to support themselves (not nice that they have to), but they do shit that makes travelling about as inconvenient as possible. I don't know about other countries, but the rule of standing by the side of the subway doors to let people out is actually written here, and somehow there are always at least a few people, invariably old, who think they're exempt. They'll stand right in the middle of the door to get on asap. Some stand aside when they see people want to get out, but others push their way in.\n\nAt my stop at the end of the line, and probably others, they'll squeeze at the door and once they open, sprint to the stairs. This is actually okay. They have the right of way (remember we're getting off now), and everyone wants to get out quickly. I have a shuttle bus to catch, and they might have one too. But once they reach the stairs, they slow to a fucking crawl, making a wall of slowness that holds up everyone behind them. I can understand they can't descend as fast as younger people, but don't fucking rush to the front if you're not at least moving at an average pace. You only get a benefit of being in front if you're faster than  the guy in front of you.\n\nThere's this one lady in particular that pisses me off every morning. She's one of those that shoves her way in. She's short and fat and looks at everything like it disgusts her. This kind of fuckface isn't the main thing, but it acts as a multiplier. Once she gets on, she'll rush (waddle quickly) to a seat. That's okay, you're supposed to let the elderly sit anyway. But if there is no seat, she stands in the middle and refuses to hold onto a pole, despite clearly being unable to balance. And she knows this. Every time the train brakes, she stumbles toward the front. So she faces the back and waddles, bumping into people and getting in the way. When the  train brakes, she stumbles back the same distance and bumps people again\n\nSo am I justified in being mad (this has happened every day for the past 3 months) or should I just excuse them because it's shitty they still have to work at their age?

We've been friends ever since, staying close (pre-internet!) even when we lived far apart. For the last decade we have lived in the same town and been very close. We'd usually see each other a couple times a week, and we have a group of friends that get together at least once a month. But May has been my best friend my whole adult life.\n\nIn the past decade, we have both had ups and downs, because shit happens. She went through five years of progressively worse pain that resulted in a hysterectomy. She always wanted babies (we met and bonded when she was babysitting a mutual friend's daughter) and she was obviously crushed by knowing she'd never have her own. Through all of those years of pain and depression, I was always there for her, as a shoulder to cry on, for distraction when she wanted, or just to listen when she had to explode. Once I stayed with her for two days when her husband feared she might self-harm. In the last year, her life has come together nicely; she and her husband bought a house and a new car and they are preparing to adopt a child. I've seen a lot less of her since they bought the house but it's out in the country (I can't drive) so I expected that and haven't complained.\n\nMeanwhile, my life has fallen apart. I was diagnosed with a chronic, disabling neurological disease, my marriage disintegrated, I can't work in my field anymore because of my diagnosis, and other life crap. Through all of it, I have relied on May; she's the only friend I've felt comfortable being totally honest with (besides my therapist), not having to wear a social mask and pretend things are better than they really are. I'm not generally a negative person; even with my life getting harder, I still look forward to every day, and I still expect that things will turn around eventually. \n\nLast night, May came over for a \"quick visit.\" She told me that she has been coming over less because she can't handle being my friend while I am \"so negative\" about life, always focused on what's going wrong. She said that she doesn't have the energy to be there for me when I don't recognize the good things in life and refuse to \"look on the bright side.\"\n\nThis was completely out of left field. I had no idea that sharing my honest feelings and experiences translated to me being \"hopeless\" and \"negative.\" So I asked for an example. She referred to a conversation we had about whether I should look for a new medical specialist, in which I listed my problems with the current one and asked her advice. When we initially had the conversation she agreed with me that I should look for a new one. Last night she said that instead of focusing on \"all those problems\" I should just be thankful that I have insurance and can get help, instead of griping about how my specialist isn't good enough.\n\nNow I feel like I have to sugar coat every conversation I have with every one. I'm also a little bit angry that she's not willing to be there for me in the same way I was for her. I'll get over the anger, I know it's a temporary emotion and I'm never one to hold a grudge. I can't help feeling disappointed in her though, because I thought she was a good friend and I already miss having someone I can just be myself around,  without having to wear a fake \"social smile.\" Am I the asshole for wanting my friend to accept me for me, even though my life is shitty right now?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the insightful comments. I was feeling no less hurt by my BFF's confession that she doesn't BFF me back but I was moving toward acceptance of yet another thing that needs a \"new normal\"... and then I got an fb Message from May.\n\nImportant: I don't go on fb, ever, I just have the Messenger app. One of the big reasons I don't go on fb is because I have a bad habit of becoming emotionally invested in educating people who post clickbait pseudoscience articles. May helped me make the decision to get off of fb entirely because of a meltdown I had after a popular bastardization of statistics made the rounds last fall.\n\nMay sent me a link to an fb clickbait article titled \"Someone Somewhere cured their Incurable Disease by following this Totally Restrictive Fad Diet!\"  (*It is for a totally different disease,* not the one I have.) \n\n*...huhWhut?*\n-----------\nTL/DR: My best friend doesn't want to spend as much time together because she thinks my perspective on my life is too negative but I was there for her during years of horrible shit in her life.

My roommate is an avid redditor so I made a new account... Anyways, recently my roommate (roommate 1) has decided to let her boyfriend and his roommate move into our house. Roommate 1's boyfriend has been living at our house (not paying rent OR UTILITIES) since the beginning of last semester, basically as long as they have been together. Well roommate 1's boyfriend, BF1 and his roommate, Curly, pay rent at a house about five minutes away in a slightly sketchier part of town. Well, apparently their house has been broken into before and they would like to move.\n\n*** clarification time***\n\nRoommate 2 and I share a bathroom and each have separate rooms. Roommate 1's dad owns the house and knows roommate 2 and I live here. (He lives across the country) Well, when roommate 2 and I moved in, we were under the impression that we right checks to roommate 1 and she sends the money to her dad. We recently learned that the money roommate 1 receives stays with her and that her \"allowance\" so her dad doesn't have to give her any money. Okay, that's fine. *** end clarification***\n\nWe all agreed that it is okay for Curly and BF1 to move in since school ends in May and their lease isn't up until February 27th. So they'll be here for only 2ish months. Fine. Well, roommate 2 and I expected our rent to go down since we will be losing living space upstairs and in the kitchen and living room, etc. Roommate 1 had even said a few things along the lines of lowering rent. Curly and BF1 are splitting rent for the upstairs room (even though BF1 lives in the master BR with roommate1). Roommate 2 and I ask roommate 1 what our rent will be after this month and roommate 1 says it will not change. She said that we \"pay for the room\" when we pay rent every month. Roommate 1s dad does not know that these dudes are moving in here and he specifically told her that no men, especially boyfriends are not allowed to live here. Fine, but roommate 1 will be receiving an extra $500+utilities a month on top of the $300+utilities that she gets from roommate 2 and I.\n  \nRoommate 1 told us that since we pay by room rent will not go down. She told us that her mother (who is not married to roommate 1's dad) is the property manager, which we had not been aware of until last night. Apparently roommate 1 and her mother have agreed that it is fair for roommate 1 to receive this extra money from the boys living in the house without telling the actual owner of the house. That seems sketchy to me. I asked her to please talk to her mother and let her know that roommate 2 and I are upset about the rent not going down. She has been avoiding my texts all day and she has not been to the house yet. When we approached her she was silent and did not say anything during the entire 20 \"conversation\" where roommate 2 and I said we were upset and that it was unfair that her boyfriend didn't contribute and we would appreciate it if her and BF1 would clean up after themselves better since more people are moving in.\n\nRoommate 2 and I never signed anything because roommate 1s dad does not officially lease out the house. We did pay a $300 deposit when moving in. I asked for roommate 1's moms phone number since she has not tried to talk to her about it or even tried to work with us.\nRoommate 2 and I are feeling cheated out of our money, but we can't move out because I am graduating in May and will not be able to sign a lease. Roommate 1 feels that we are cornering her and being disrespectful by being upset by rent staying the same while our living space is being occupied by two more people (even though BF1 has been here for almost six months without contributing).\n\nAre roommate 2 and I assholes?\n\n\ntl;dr: Roommate 1 is moving her BF and his roommate into our house that she does not pay rent or utilities for since her dad owns it. Roommate 2 and I feel that our rent should be reduced. Roommate 1, who is to gain an extra $500 a month, plots with her mother against the owner of the house so that Roommate 1 will be rolling in mine and my roommate's hard earned dough. Roommate 1 is very offended that roommate 2 and I do not want to pay the same amount for less space.", "score": 17, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "46ipfi", "name": "t3_46ipfi", "created_utc": 1455853049.0, "title": "AITA for asking my husband to take our daughter off my hands?", "link_flair_text": "not enough info", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 45, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "46orsy", "name": "t3_46orsy", "created_utc": 1455945398.0, "title": "AITA for cock-blocking my roommate", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "So last night was kind of crazy. We all got trashed and headed to the bars, and by the end of the night we saw my RA downtown. She's a really cool person so we didn't fear her, we ran up to her and gave her hugs hello. By the end of the night though, my roommate was getting damn close with her and it was pretty obvious she was trying to go back with him. I was shocked to witness such a legend unfold, but my friends started to step in and try to separate them, which I realized was totally a good idea. \n\nMy roommate and I sell pot on campus and he recently made a hallucinogen pickup, so our room was loaded with tons of drugs. We're safe about all that though, so it's never usually anything to worry about. \n\nBy the time we made it back to campus after my RA took a cab with us, my friends who had kept the couple separate had to go home, so I had to take more of an active role. We got him away from her and back to my room, but he was being drunk and unreasonable and kept talking about how he wanted \"to win.\" He rambled on saying how fucking your RA would achieve \"diplomatic immunity\" as a dealer. I argued that such immunity would only last until they stopped fucking and the RA realizes how her job was on the line, when she would likely throw my roommate under the bus to save herself. And if the room ever got searched after this \"diplomatic immunity\" ended, I would become my roommate's cellmate. For a long time. \n\nFed up with his drunk crap, I saw an opportunity to slap him and took it. I hoped it would either slap some sense into him, sober him up a bit, or make him take a step back and think about the situation from another perspective. I continued to try to reason with him but his mind was made, and I was a dick for cockblocking. \n\nAlbeit it would be legendary to fuck your RA, am I unreasonable for expecting my roommate should wait till the last week of the semester, rather than possibly throwing away both of our lives?

This was around two years ago or so? We used to be high school buddies, then drifted away, then we got to catch up online and sort of came out to each other. We have a completely disjoint set of friends now.\n\nThing is, I'm the only friend he ever came out to. I live in a country where the culture is just starting to accept same sex relationships. So it's still a bit taboo in a sense. But not too taboo.\n\nJust in case he came out to me because he's interested in me, I made it clear that I'm not.\n\nEverything I say onwards happened online now, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAt first, it wasn't yet a burden that he'd exclusively talk to me about guys he likes. It's like 99% of our conversation topics. At first it was fine. But then it gets tiring, since he keeps on sharing of guys I don't know and tells how hot they are. During the first few days, I was fine with it. But then it got old very fast. Especially since we're basically leading different lives now and I'm pretty much disconnected with what he's doing.\n\nI told him this and tried to suggest that he tell other friends (friends that he hangs out with personally these days). This is because (a) I'm not too interested in ogling strangers. (b) I think it's healthier to have someone you see on a personal basis to be some kind of support friend for being bi.\n\nHe holds this belief that he can be happy without coming out to any more people. And I hold this belief that it's always better to at least let your close friends know. So basically, with his principle, I remain the only friend with whom he's out to.\n\nToday, I came to the realization that I am in some way enabling him not coming out to any more people because he can always have someone to talk to. This is because he talked to me about this guy he's getting close with and that he wants to know if he's straight or not and if he's interested. And if he is, hopefully he is also someone who wants to keep to the closet.\n\nMy patience with tolerating this lifestyle grew thin because of the reasons stated above AND because I get stressed thinking that things could be better for him if he came out to other close friends. And so, I told him I'm not comfortable discussing boys with him anymore. He tells me he's not stressed about things.\n\nSo basically, I just implied that we act as if he never told me he was bi. And just discuss things that do not involve his crushes.\n\nHe tells me that he could be happy closeted for an indefinite amount of time. And I feel that I'm the one who's closed-minded because I do not believe that. It may just be a difference in opinions. Or maybe he has his own reasons to stay closeted. But to be on point: **Am I the asshole for refusing to entertain my friend discussing these topics because I don't tolerate his lifestyle?**\n\n---\n\n^(To present an analogy and a potential TLDR, it's like having a friend who keeps on arguing with his SO. Friend doesn't see it as a problem but you know it is. You give advice to said friend. Friend doesn't follow advice. And so the same problem occurs over and over. You get tired of hearing it.

I told her she should start switching it back to rain when she got out of the shower, just to be considerate to the people (two of us,) who use the shower after her. She said why should she, when, hypothetically, if she did use the jet for the entire shower, I never flip it back to jet when I'm done with rain for her. I said that didn't make sense. Number one, majority rules. If two of us use rain and one uses jet, rain should be the default. Number two, she'd just admitted to using the rain, so my flipping it off of jet is actually doing her the favor. She said that's not the point, and that it didn't take very much energy for me to switch it anyway. It doesn't, but it's annoying as hell to reach up and twist the shower head and have the cool water being pushed out go down your arm.

He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\n\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\n\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\n\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \n\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\n\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \nSo I did something very stupid. \nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \n\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\n\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\n\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\n\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?", "score": 27, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "47ehk9", "name": "t3_47ehk9", "created_utc": 1456343487.0, "title": "AITA for pushing my grandma?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 26, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "47eqxj", "name": "t3_47eqxj", "created_utc": 1456346407.0, "title": "AITA for being upset with my mother?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "47ffhq", "name": "t3_47ffhq", "created_utc": 1456352420.0, "title": "Charming and attractive girl will brighten up your leisure.

From the very beginning, Francis latched onto the team out of nowhere when we were assigned into a group for our class but we decided to be nice and let him stay on our team. Soon after, we saw that he was incompetent in writing and didn't have the skills that we need for the project but we still decided to give him the benefits of the doubt, seeing how it was only at the beginning and he might need some time to improve. However, as time went on, we saw that he repeatedly slacked off whenever we meetup to work on our project. We all knew this but nobody wanted to tell him that he's been burdening us with \"babysitting\" him and making sure that he does his portion of the project.\n\nAnd so today, after seeing how he was on his phone again and not paying attention while we were racking our brains on this hard assignment, I decided that it was the last straw for me and called him out on it. I listed out all the things that he has been doing such as the lack of focus, the lack of quality contributions and so on (all of which we know are true). But of course, he felt shocked and was genuinely surprised by why am I \"low-balling\" his contributions when in fact, us remaining three made up of most of the contribution in the team. Apparently, I upset and offended him for telling him something that were all on our minds, even though we should have told him from the very beginning. \n\nTo his credits, he did contribute a tiny amount of effort to the team since the team leader has assigned him a couple of tasks that he completed. However, they are completely trivial tasks that any one of us could have done but we wanted to keep him busy (again..BABYSITTING!!). We are all excited about this project and he is only one who does not have the same drive as well as talents and dedication as the rest of us. Sure, he is enthusiastic about what we do but when he can't even pull his own weight - you start to wonder what exactly is he good for and why should we give him this much credit when we have to do the majority of things ourselves? All he had to back up his case were empty promises of getting better and improving when all we have seen so far has been disappointing at best. How could you trust anyone to improve and get better when they don't even put the efforts into learn new things? For fuck's sake, he doesn't even want to learn the thing that he claimed he was good at when it was front of him... I rest my case. \n\nI honestly think that my teammates are being too nice to him. They still believe that he can improve even though he has not done a single thing to prove his worth. This is going to affect our productivity in the future if this kept going. As far as I'm concerned, we are overcrediting him if he keeps being this way and the project is soon to be finalized. \n\nSo... with all that said, am I the asshole for addressing the elephant in the room and speaking the truth?", "score": 22, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "482f1g", "name": "t3_482f1g", "created_utc": 1456669437.0, "title": "Not busy night?

We're in the process of finding a new roommate, and my other roommate really wants the room. The problem is, he's currently a month and a half behind on rent as it is, and has no real steady income. At the moment he's an adjunct professor making barely enough to get by on the few classes he teaches (and has no work come summertime), meanwhile I have a pretty steady and larger flow of income. I think I should take the more expensive room in our apartment because of this, but he wants it and is angry that I'm even bringing up the idea of taking it. When one of us is late on rent, it looks bad on everyone, and although he says he'll be caught up on rent by next week, I just don't think his financial situation is good enough for him to be able to handle the extra money that'll come with that room. \nI should also mention that I'm the one carrying the burden of scheduling viewings of the apartment and taking pics/making posts on rental sites.

When he moved in, he agreed that he would help to clean the place; said it would  be no problem. \n\nThe master bedroom he lives in has a bathroom. I consider it a half-bathroom and only worth the toilet, sink and storage - BUT it's technically a full bathroom with a stupid shower you can't stand up in. We told him it was cool if he used the common bathroom to shower as long as he helped clean the bathroom, and he agreed. \n\nThe day he moved in, he insisted that he can't use the toilet in that bathroom either (it's an old building built in the 30s so it *is* awkward). We said that we could all share the common area bathroom as long as he helped out with the responsibilities. \n\nMONTHS LATER, ~~he hasn't cleaned anything~~ *edit: in the first 6-7 months he lived with us, he only cleaned the bathroom maybe twice. He himself admits it was \"maybe a few times\".* I clean my bathroom weekly, so we typically cleaned it about 24 times in that timeframe. We'd ask him to clean the bathroom, and then he'd leave the apartment and say he isn't home and can't clean - and he'd never clean it even after he got back. He hasn't helped buy toilet paper. He hasn't bought cleaning supplies. He hasn't taken the trash out. Nothing. We had a discussion about it and talking to him about this frustrated us to the point that he was told to just not worry about it we will deal with it ourselves. \n\nFor the last few months he has lived here, not coming out of his room, not talking to us, not buying toilet paper or cleaning supplies or anything, and not helping to clean the bathroom. But he keep using it, and he's been in that bathroom while we had to get ready for work. \n\nI understand not using the shower in his bathroom, because you have to sit to use it and use a shower head on a hose - it's not great but other roommates have preferred to do that instead of share a bathroom. However, he uses the common bathroom for EVERYTHING- toilet, shower, etc. If he uses his private bathroom it's basically for the sink and for storage. He even leaves all of his shower stuff in the common bathroom even though he has his own bathroom. \n\nNow, he is upset at having to pay so much money in utilities, and he wanted to split it differently. So when he brought up the money he think he shouldn't have to pay, I brought up the fact that WE pay for the toilet paper he has used for 8 months, the fact that we buy cleaning supplies AND clean even though he doesn't, the fact that WE buy the salt and shovels to get our cars out, and the fact that he doesn't help with ANY of that. I don't really care that he doesn't clean the floors or the kitchen because he doesn't use them - he sits around inn his room and in the bathroom. \n\nI brought these things up to him. I don't want to be taken advantage of anymore, and if he wants to split the utilities differently, I want him to either use his own bathroom exclusively or start helping us clean and buy toilet paper for the common area bathroom that he uses instead of his. \n\nHe proceeded to tell me he was doing US a favor, got shitty, and **eventually agreed to clean every third week. (three people living here, bathroom gets cleaned once a week)**. \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\nedit: (I ask because honestly I can't stand his attitude and how he treats us, and if we ask him to leave when the lease is up I want to know that we explored all options.)\n\n\n**tl;rd - 3 people share 1 bathroom. 1 guy doesnt clean, buy cleaning supplies, or buy toilet paper for about 9 months. Cleans bathroom twice. Decides he wants to pay less in utilities and then acts like we're the asshole when we agree to split it differently in exchange him agreeing to clean bathroom every 3 weeks.**", "score": 25, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "49as84", "name": "t3_49as84", "created_utc": 1457322444.0, "title": "Running without headphones", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "49aumq", "name": "t3_49aumq", "created_utc": 1457323396.0, "title": "AITA running with no headphones and playing music out of my phone", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "AITA for running with music playing out of my speakerphone?

Maybe I can teach the world to stop holding doors open for me by giving it a taste of its own medicine.

Like I said, we watch movies and TV shows nearly every night out of the week, we have a Skype schedule, etc. and she said that I treat her like \"something that I fit in when I can.\" I only see my dad a few days out of the month, I just wanted a night to hang out with him. \n", "score": 31, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "49x3mj", "name": "t3_49x3mj", "created_utc": 1457669986.0, "title": "AITA For Taking A Nap?", "link_flair_text": "no a--holes here", "selftext": "I am visiting my parents. I was only supposed to be here for a few days, but both my mom and dad are sick enough to need some help and I didn't want to leave them alone. There was a bit of an argument on Monday (over something my sister did that I got caught in the cross hairs of). My mother begged me to come back and I decided to because if she needs me I am going to be here. My sister could help. She lives a lot closer (a half and hour away), but isn't, despite the fact my parent do everything for her. But that is a different story for a different day.\n\nAnyways, my mom doesn't let me help out a lot. I made dinner one night, she insisted on making dinner yesterday, and we ordered out today (I would have been happy to cook). I have my two young kids with me. They are 3 years old and almost 2 years old. My parents want the kids here because they miss them when we are gone (I live two hours away). My dad has stayed away because he doesn't want to pass them his germs and my mom insists she is better.\n\nI am sick myself. I came down here for a doctor's appointment and my issue was not resolved. I also now have the flu my parents have. That said, I try to help out as much as I can. My husband will be helping too, when he comes down tomorrow after work.\n\nToday, my mom takes the kids in the yard to play. I told her I wished she had run that by me before getting them excited because I had no ability to chase them around outside (you can't exactly run when you have the runs) and she says its no problem and takes them out for a half an hour with my grandma (who lives next door). When she came in I must have had a fever. I was shaking under a blanket, but I was trying to hold it together. My mom put a blanket over me and told me to put my head down for a bit. I didn't even go into my room. I was on the couch in case she needed me. The kids jumped on me and such, but I heard my mom tell them to leave me alone. I finally wake up and she is mad because I was out for about 3 hours! I didn't know it had been that long. I was feverish,  a bit delirious, and hadn't eaten all day. I would have gotten up and helped if she had just woken me up. I feel guilty, but it wasn't on purpose. I was just so exhausted. I would have fought sleep more if I knew it was a problem.\n\nSorry for the rant. I am on heavy medication as I pulled all the muscles in my chest and lots in my back. \n\n\ntl;dr: I feel accidentally sleep for a few hours today, leaving my mom to watch the kids.

The sort of official meaning for disrespect within the smash community is beating somebody while they're already down. For example, someone is knocked off the stage but can't get back on, but then the opponent jumps off and hits them further, basically overkill. However, the meaning of the word has widened significantly over time. \n\nNow for the actual story. I was in a smash tournament, which I won in the end. I actually played the guy who I \"disrespected\" earlier on as-well as in the finals. I knocked him into losers bracket and he got really angry and had to step out for a while. No big, this happens all the time in venues. People get really into the game. After a while we hit the finals and he has won in the losers bracket. I didn't drop a single game up until that point when he beat me. In smash brothers tournaments, we play a set with best out of X amount of games against each person. Think Tennis in a sense. We were doing Bo3 matches throughout including in GF (although many do Bo5 for finals matches). He beat me in the first finals game of the set. Then in the second game he starts out at a lead but I gimp (use a weak move to stop the opponent from coming back to the stage) him which lead to me gaining traction and winning that game. So now we are at 1-1. At this point he was already getting angry and I was getting annoyed at him for getting so angry at a game. \n\nIn the third game, he starts off strong but I take a stock (life) off of him and he can't seem to figure my strategy out. He's playing as Cloud from Final Fantasy 7. Cloud has a special move that is essentially a charge meter you can actively charge. Once charged all the way, your stats are boosted for a while until you use another special move. In Smash Bros tournaments, if there is a time-out where the clock hits 0:00,then the person with more stocks wins the game. \n\nI noticed that I could run down the clock or take another stock from him to close out the game, set, and tournament, but I decided to \"disrespect\" him. instead of trying to come after me, he kept charging his charge meter so I started using taunts(little animations that mostly don't deal damage) to pass the time since I didn't need to go after him and also to, literally, taunt him towards attacking me. \n\nMy opponent didn't want any of that and became verbal in his opinion of my taunts. He called it disrespect even though we were both in the neutral state of game (neither side has a clear positional advantage) and proceeded to quit instead of attack me. I taunted him three times before he quit which led to a very lackluster victory. I didn't see him at all afterwards. \n\n\nI asked some friends about it but they usually have similar opinions as I do, hence why we get along so well. \n\nTldr; Taunted him to me, made him end up committing sudoku\n\nSo, what am I missing, am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses. I've thought about all of them and it seems like those who don't know the smash scene tend to side with me, but those who are big into it do in fact think I'm an asshole. I guess it all came down to the connotation of taunting within a match which is indeed seen as completely immoral to many in the smash community. I don't think I'm the asshole here, but based on the replies here, my opponent's state of mind needs to be thought of as well during a match.

We both plan on entering university this year, and there is a big chance of us having to do long distance during our bachelors. I want to pursue dentistry (a five year bachelors plus masters course) because it'll give us a cushy income and I wouldn't have to work as much as a doctor, giving me time to focus on my family. He wants to pursue a mechanical engineering degree (3 years bachelors) and then would like to do a masters (additional 2 years). \n\nThe reason we might have to do long distance is because dentistry in the city we live in is very, very difficult to get in, compared to other nearby cities. I simply do not have the grades to make it in here. He says must stay here, because he can't afford to pay for his mom's rent, as well as his own if he lives somewhere else. I understand this. While I'm still part of the lower class, his family has an even lower financial status than mine.\n\nHis dad sends him money every month for their rent, even though his parents are divorced. His mom lives off of this money, as well as the government. She only works 8 hours a week because she goes to mandatory language school, and already has quit one job because the hours were too long. She has had rheumatoid arthritis for ten years. She quit another job, where she would work for 18 hours, because she didn't like her coworkers and the job didn't fit in her time schedule. You see, even with her working 18 hours, her son could have pursued an education anywhere else (not necessarily with me, of course, but to places with a better program).\n\nHis mom has to go to school for around a year, and by law is required to then pursue another job so that she wouldn't have to live off of the government forever. That means in around a year, she MUST find a better paying job to support herself, first of all, and then her son. If she doesn't, she has to pay a hefty fine.\n\nI get that we have to do long distance for his bachelors. But, after a hypothetical four years of being together, I'd trust that he would want to move out of his mom's house and move in with me. He could find a job, or he could work, whatever floats his boat. If he were to pursue a master's, his mom would HAVE to earn more (by the law) and could support him even better than she can now.\n\nTo be honest, my boyfriend could go pursue his bachelors somewhere else already. His mother just refuses to find another job, even though he's tried to talk to her about their finances. They can barely pay their bills, but his mom has been saying that she's going to pass away soon for the past 10 years and lives her life like it's her last year. I understand that she has a really bad illness, but she's been living recklessly for the past 10 years and she's still alive. She can still work, and has a lot of time on her hands. My boyfriend doesn't want to confront her, because she can be a bit abusive at times. I'm just going to blame that on the pain caused by the arthritis.\n\nAnyways, I told my boyfriend that after his bachelors, I would not like to do long distance any longer. 3 years is already a long time, and I'm already the type of person who was never going to pursue a long distance relationship again. He says we might have to do long distance for 5 years, and I'm just not willing to wait that long. He keeps making up excuses for why he might not be able to move in with me after 3 years (for example, he may not be able to find work, he might find a better masters program elsewhere, etc). Heck, he's making up excuses not to leave his mom now. My stance is, there's never a good time to move in together, there's never a good time to get married, and there's never a good time to have kids. He keeps making up excuses, now and for the future, and I'm really turned off by it.

I was on a continent with 2 friends, 2 were together, 1 was by himself.  I started exploring and found my friend Jim as India down on a decent-sized island away from me.  He was complaining about going to war with a city state.  He's kinda new, so he was just sending in like 5 elephants (not the best way of doing it, but would work).  \n\nI felt kinda bad watching the city state about to get pummeled, so I thought \"hey, it'd be funny if I gifted a troop to them.\"  Gifting a unit instantly sends them across the map to that city state.  I sent over an archer, and Jim had to retreat.\n\nLater on he tried a couple more times to attack the city state, and I sent troops over there again.  After a certain point I thought it'd be funny to reveal my prank, so I said something like\n\n\"Man, that city state has a lot of firepower.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's bullshit!\"\n\n\"Jee wiz.  It's almost like they have a mysterious benefactor gifting them troops.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThen I came clean and told them I'd been sending troops.  My friends call me an asshole a few times.  The city state wasn't going to murder Jim, or anything, so I wasn't doing it out of malice, but I felt kinda bad and apologized.  Jim goes quiet for like 30 turns, and suddenly I see the \"Jim has declared war on Packrat1010.\"\n\nI'm sitting there like, \"Cmon, I'm an era ahead of you, don't go to war with me.\"\n\nHe says, \"It's already on!  This'll teach you to send troops to a guy I'm fighting.\"\n\nBasically, for anyone who hasn't played Civ, being an era apart is kind of a big deal competitively.  I have more production, can get units out faster, and have better units.\n\nSo I'm like, \"Alright, I guess.\"  I start pumping out galleass's (basically a medieval ship that can fire cannons on land) like it's nothing.  I get 6-7 up and running in a few turns, then I start sending them to his city.  On the way there, I see the boats transporting a bunch of his elephants towards me, and I just mow down the living shit out of them.\n\nNow, Jim is a little easy to upset, so I PM'd a friend of mine at the start of the war that I was willing to accept a surrender whenever he sent it.  That being said, I get to his city and just start bombing it.  He fires back and sinks one of my ships, but I just keep going.  I feel kind of good about downing his massive army that he was waving around, so I finally whittle down his city and take it.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Alright, I spanked him good, lemme send a peace treaty to him and give him his city back.\"  Well, I pull up the diplomacy screen and see that he already sent me a peace treaty.  5 turns ago.  I had absolutely no idea he sent it, since he never said anything.\n\nBasically, I started whooping him, and to him I saw the peace treaty, said \"Nah, bitch, that ass is mine,\" then just kept powering down while my friends looked on with a mix of fear and disgust. \n\nI accepted the treat, then said, \"Hey, man, I didn't realize you already sent that--\"\n\n\"Yeah, you didn't see it!\" he shouts at me,  \"You never see shit!\"\n\nThen he disconnected, and I sat through 5 or so minutes of everyone grumbling about how I \"took it too far\" and \"was muttering obscenities under your breath as you sunk his cavalry ships like wax boats.\"  After that everyone sorta got off.

It's fairly small, and the walls are pretty standard student housing fare (thin with little to no insulation, leading to almost any amount of noise carrying through the whole house). A few weeks ago, my roommates complained that my computer was too loud at night (completely  reasonable complaint on their part, I thought I had it quiet enough but misjudged how shitty the insulation was), so I responded by apologizing and started carefully policing the volume after they went to bed, and keeping it at the level I thought it originally had to be at earlier to keep it a reasonable volume.

A couple of the nights that my volume was too loud, my girlfriend was staying over, so the roommates now associate her with the loud volume, which in my opinion is unfair to her, considering that my habits are the same whether she's home or not, and I honestly try even harder to keep things quiet when she's around because I recognize the burden that having an extra person around can be, especially in a small place.\n\nAs for the specific situation that most recently occurred, this morning I had to leave my girlfriend at home while I went to school, because she is too sick to be attending classes (she currently can't talk without extreme pain, and is basically living off of throat lozenges and cough syrup). Obviously leaving her alone isn't normal or ideal, but I wasn't about to ask her to leave the house, considering if I were in her place I would be sending myself to a clinic to get checked out (she's the \"I'll just suffer until my body beats it\" type).

His bus is in an hour, and it takes at most 20 minutes to get there from the subway station. So i stop at the corner at a red light for him to get out. I say \"ok ill stop here so you can get out\",\nand he sort of snaps at me to at least grab his bag from the back seat (we are in a fiat too by the way, close quarters.). Then the light turns green and i sort of snap back \"Get out the lights green!\" So he grabs his back quickly and punches me as he leaves, calling me a selfish asshole.\nThis really pissed me off. So pissed I wanted to run over the biker in the bicycle lane next to me. All weekend I ran around for him.\nI let him use my computer to write a paper since he forgot his charger. Did i get a thank you when i asked for it back when he was done? No, when i asked to have it back, I got a snappy \"One sec!\" as he surfed Facebook. Eventually i just grabbed my laptop out of his hands. Did i get a thankyou when he asked my to drive him to the subway to go play soccer, which is about a 20 minute drive away (on easter sunday)? No, i got complaints that I wouldn't drive him all the way to soccer, and a sales pitch on taking him all the way there instead of just to the subway. Finally I gave in and drove him all the way there.  \n\nSo, naturally I called my dad just to vent a bit. A few minutes later I get a text from him saying I deserved to get punched since the way I told him to get out of the car wasn't nice. He told me to stop acting like a 12 year old and tattling on dad. I responded saying I'll stop being a 12 year old when you stop acting like a baby with a tantrum when he doesn't get his own way,\nand called him out on acting incredibly selfish all weekend. He then responded with an essay of a text saying how I never ask him about himself and how I don't do anything unless it benefits me.  \n\nI pointed out how on facebook (our main medium of talking, since we live 2 hours from eachother)\nI have initiated every conversation, sharing something interesting or funny with him, asking him when he's home next etc.\nAnd the last time he started a conversation was in February asking me to send him money. (my dad gives him ~1300 a month - he went through a thousand in 2 days this past week paying off bets he lost and buying himself new pants) \"Yea, im so selfish didn't give you the opporunity to talk about yourself. \" I say.  \n\nTL;DR: I drive my brother around town since he cant drive. I let him use my computer to write a paper. I take him to pick up his shoes last minute. He punches me for burdening him with a 2 block trip  he can either walk or go by streetcar. Calls me an asshole for never asking him about his life. I do talk to him a lot, but its not good enough I guess until I ask him about his life. meanwhile he only initiates conversation when he needs money.", "score": 24, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4cl9sk", "name": "t3_4cl9sk", "created_utc": 1459351935.0, "title": "AITA For going fishing?", "link_flair_text": "asshole", "selftext": "This situation is the center of a two year long argument between my group of friends.

Without going into exactly why, I've been told that except for one tooth, all my teeth will have to be pulled. Naturally I'm not thrilled about it. I'm only 28, and in addition to that I've developed bald spots and have been struggling with depression. In addition to that I'm not great around strangers, so going to the dentist is already unpleasant to me (pain not withstanding). After I got my first appointment I messaged my dentist over viber to confirm the date and time. She is my age and seemed rather friendly. We talked for a bit after that about random things and joked around. I knew she was married and I personally didn't find her attractive even though objectively I consider her pretty. I made some (in hindsight) possibly inappropriate jokes, but she didn't react negatively at the time. In fact, the next day she told me how much she had to hold back not to laugh too loud and wake her infant daughter. We talked maybe once or twice after that, but not nearly as long. Fast forward a few days later, I'm in the waiting room. She opens the door and tells me to come inside. As I step in I see a guy standing in the room. I'm thinking he's leaving as I'm going in and don't think much about it. I start taking my jacket off and the guy sits down (There's chairs for when she's taking a break in the room, it's separate from the waiting room). Already I'm confused. She tells me to lay down on the weirdly shaped dentist  hair. A thousand thoughts rush through my head. \"What is she doing? Is she gonna pull my teeth in front of that random stranger?\" I'm not feeling comfortable at all about this, but she just casually gives me the anesthetic. As soon as she's done injecting it she starts talking with the guy. I turn around and see him reading patients files. She tells him not to do that,  while smiling and giggling. He just looks at her and smiles back. I'm completely lost and raging inside. She walks back to me and pulls a tooth out, then essentially rushes me out. As I'm putting my jacket on she asks the guy if the bleeding stopped. It's at this point that I realize he's just a patient who decided it's OK to be present during my appointment and read private information about other patients. A few hours after arriving home I message my sister, describing what happened and asking for advice. She agrees with me that what she did was not alright. I message her about rescheduling the next appointment for a different day, but she says that she has no more spots left for that day. \"Can we not have moronic spectators the next time?\" I ask. \"That moron is my cousin. Yeah, no problem, cya monday\" she replies. I'm still pretty pissed off at this point, thinking I don't care who he was, he's not supposed to be present. But I leave it at that. The next day I start feeling bad about it, despite knowing i did nothing wrong, and decide to apologize to her. She says it's fine, not an issue and she'll see me Monday. Today I arrive at my appointment just as she opens the door. She seemed like she didn't notice me, not really looking at me, but as she closes the door she tells me to come in. I go inside and there's a woman sitting at the same spot her cousin was, but she bends down to her and whispers something, at which point the woman gets up and goes to sit down in the waiting room. She tells me to lay down and I do. I ask her if she's alright, and she says she's great. I ask her if she's angry and she says we'll talk. \"Alright, this isn't going to be pleasant. She's clearly pissed and about to stick a needle in my gums\" is what's going through my head. She sort of harshly sticks the needle in my gums and then says \"listen, I'm a dentist, you're my patient. You have stepped out of the line with your jokes. You personally insulted me. What if it was a doctor sitting there? Would you want me to throw them out, too?\" I reply that I would be fine if another doctor was present, but not some random guy. She continues with \"I've been more than nice to you. From now on I'm going to a dress you with sir and there will be no more messages. That man was my brother (even though she said it was her cousin, now she says it's her brother). Pulling teeth isn't  $2000 (not sure why she brought that up, she just randomly did) alright?\" I say yeah, alright. She pulls 2 teeth and sends me home.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to make sure I explain the situation properly. I feel like she brought up the jokes because I called her cousin an idiot, and not because she took issue with them, although I would understand if she did even though I considered them harmless at the time. As uncomfortable as I felt before about going to the dentist, it's 10 times worse now.

My father and I don't get along that well. \n\nFirst of all, my father is in his early 60s and is an avid bicyclist. He's been in this hobby for about 7 years, give or take, after some family issues. However, my mother and I believe that it has taken over his like,I mean, like, addiction levels. \n\nHe has spent thousands of dollars on this hobby and has invested himself into the local government with it. He aims to ride hundreds of miles a month and it has reached the level where my mother and I don't think anything of him riding 70 miles. While I am annoyed in general about all the talk of it, he's always on the equivalent of bike-facebook and gets upset about likes and shit, I kinda don't overly care. Or at least I stopped when I moved out 5 years ago.\n\nHowever, my mother has always had issues with it. She was happy and supportive at first, but this has declined. She has been angry and upset and hurt by the bike over the last few years. This is due to massive expense, the amount of times he's been hurt by it -twice before this, both times hospitalized. The first time he broke his back and went back to riding and the second time he destroyed his fingers and went back to it -and no 17 year old wants to get a call from the cops that their father was in an accident. \n\nAnyway, she is also hurt because of the fact that he has neglected the rest of his life. His schedule revolves around the bike, and I'm not kidding. He plans around the rides he wants, has maintenance hours, and does a lot of shit. The problem is that it's in excess, he rides multiple times a week, not including to and from work. \n\nBecause of this, he has neglected the house, badly. They have a pool, and it is basically a swamp. The house needed a lot of maintenance for a while, due to damage from a storm, and the house was left missing infrastructure for about 2/3 years. Apperently, whenever my mom tried to fix it, my dad would get upset that she was going behind her back. But then he wouldn't do anything himself or try, so my mom would and they'd fight. \nMy mom would give up because of this and just be upset. \n\nThis issue happened multiple times for a variety of things, a lot of  stuff. Furniture, paint, carpet -they're walking on ripped up carpet in their bedroom, flooring, etc. He'd go to work, go ride again, and then come home \"grumpy\" and get upset at my mother if she didn't have food ready. A lot of, \"You know how I am and how I should eat!\" bullshit\n\nHe would take time off work for rides and inconvenience his associates and such. I had heard him ranting to my mother about how unimpressed and unsympathetic they were due to his activities.\n\n He'd also neglect the family, I'm not fully aware of all the details here. But like, I know that he has blown of time with my brother to ride, when he visited me in my university, they had to drive so he could bring the bike, and my sister once commented that, \"Wow, I can't believe you came here instead of bike riding.\"\n\nMy mother and I, were fairly close, always stated that he wouldn't stop until he got hurt. Which he did. He ended up getting hit by a drunk driver and is in the hospital. Unfortunately, he is not going to recover anytime soon. And I mean, years, and we'll be lucky if he can walk again. He is still talking about the bike and how it's his \"one true passion and the one thing he cares about in life.\" Which my mom is upset by, as he was under meds, so it was more truthful than just being sober or shit.\n\nBut now, he's gonna lose his job and he's immobile for the future. So, my mom, whose been a wreck, since he is a shit patient, is freaking out. \n\nHere's my problem, I'm not upset that he got hit, but I am upset that put himself in that situation; which i feel might just be upset blaming. But I am angry at the fact that my life has now changed, I had plans in May, June, and July and now they're up in the air because I have to go help him. He can't come to my graduation because he is hurt, he can't do anything, and now I am sacked into helping him. And he doesn't feel bad about it, he feels offended that he got hit and puts no blame into himself. I have to basically put my life on hold to help him and I feel upset at that. I'm also upset that I now have to deal with my mother, who is a rightful-wreck, and try to make sure that she's taking care of herself. I'm upset because I have a new nephew and my brother has been with my dad instead of his son. My mother hasn't seen her grandson since the birth because she wont leave the hospital.\n\nI don't mind helping the family, I did for his previous accidents, but I'm hurt how its impacted me. I can't even enjoy post-grad life because I have to rush home to help my mother. \n\nMy mom on the other hand is 'burdening' me with this information, she's always crying and ranting to me about him. About how mean he is, about his medical shit, about how he cant shit and complains to her, who complains to me. \n\nI just feel angry and upset about the situation I've been thrusted in. I'm angry that he did this to himself and still doesn't see what he did wrong, ignore my victim blaming. I'm upset that I now have to drop plans to take care of him. I'm upset that he wont see me graduate, something I was excited about. I'm angry on how its hurt my mother and how i'm being affected by it.\n\nAm I rightful for feeling this way or am I an asshole, because I honestly don't even know. \n\ntl;dr: Dad's bike addiction caused him to neglect the rest of his life and I feel that it is and was selfish; I'm also upset that I had to deal with that and my mother second hand because of it. I'm upset at him that he got himself hit and how it has impacted me and my mother.  My father doesn't seem to think he was in any fault, is offended, and hasn't learned shit.\n\nAlso, sorry for the long writing. I didn't think I was that upset, but I felt that it needed some context.

This is what happened:\n\n-I very explicitly stated that before moving forward, I wanted to know how much the piece of wood would cost. They said, \"It kinda of depends on how long it will take to sand it down. As it is now $60.\" They asked me if I wanted a gloss coat, and I said yes. They said it would be ready in early April.\n\n-I contacted them today asking how the progress was going and they said it would be ready by Monday. I asked them how much the total cost would be. Given the only amount of money they had disclosed to me cost-wise was $60, I assumed it wouldn't deviate too much from that. Instead, they were asking for $300 (all for a 6' x 18'\" x 1\" piece of wood). \n\n-I said: \"I see. You said in an earlier message that it would be around $60-$100. If you look at the initial messages I sent you on March 10th, you stated that. Was there something I missed?\"\n\n-They said: \"I said 60 for the 6 by 18 as it was, Without any work put into it. Then I asked if you wanted it sanded and glossed it would all depend on how many hours was put into it and the quality of the finished product. If you buy any type of wood for furniture and it is a finished product it will be pricey not to mention custom made.\"\n\n-I said: \"Clearly I have never  bought anything of this sort before, I feel like an idiot. It would have been nice to have had a final price estimate based upon what I asked for, but that was my fault for not being explicit.\"\n\n-They said: \"I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.\"\n\n-It went back and forth like this, and I argued that they should have been straightforward with their pricing, while they argued that I should have asked all the questions I could before allowing them to go off and prepare the wood.\n\n-Since I didn't sign a contract, I told him I simply couldn't afford it and cut all contact.\n\nIt all just seems very strange to me; what kind of businessperson withholds pricing info and then goes off to make the product without knowing that the customer will be willing to pay the final amount?

Long before I took over, and for a few years after, the grocery store had your [traditional style checkout stands]( http://i.imgur.com/zpUTnLW.jpg) where the cashier would take your items from the first conveyor (which you typically loaded yourself), scan them, then place them on a second conveyer that would go to a bagger at the end of the stand who would then load your cart.  Practically every lane with the exception of the express lanes was set up like this.  \n\nA couple of years back the grocery store took out the old stands and replaced them with these updated ones that removed the traditional bagger\u2019s area and replaced them with the carousel-style bagging system you typically see at [self-checkouts]( http://i.imgur.com/cx29l8J.jpg).  I suppose you could describe it as a [hybrid of the two stands]( http://i.imgur.com/wgiNaWm.jpg), and though no one comes right out to say it, the intent seems clear to me; They want you to bag your own groceries.  \n\nThere are maybe 1-2 baggers/runners on shift at the time and day I go, when there used to be about one to every lane.  When they were first installed, it was a nightmare.  Lines were stacked up further back than I had ever seen, customers were upset with the new system and many were not afraid to complain to any employee that would listen.  In the time since they were first installed it has gotten a little bit better, though not as fast as it was before, and I am still not having it. \n\n I don\u2019t mind loading my own cart, but I am not going to stand there and bag the groceries when there are plenty of other grocery stores in the area (even ones owned and operated by the same company) that don\u2019t have these new stands.   Every time I shop I play a waiting game with the cashier; who is going to flinch first and start bagging the groceries?  Not I.  I look over to the next lane and see some little old lady bagging her own groceries, and I know others are looking at me and thinking \u201cLook at this asshole, if she can do it, why can\u2019t you?\u201d  My feelings are not that this little old lady should be bagging her own stuff and I shouldn\u2019t, but that neither one of us should, nor should the judging eyes.  And until the store tells me their intent is for me to bag my own stuff, I\u2019ll keep playing this little game to see who gives in first.  \n\nUpdate:  The tribe has spoken and I am indeed the asshole, and possibly Larry David.  Upon recommendation, I have contacted the store to find out what their official intent is with the new stands, and I'll give them a direct opinion about them after they get back to me.  That said, I'll probably continue to be the asshole, sorry, but I think I'd have to go to magic school and learn slight of hand before I could separate that stack of bags properly.  \n", "score": 36, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4dyx18", "name": "t3_4dyx18", "created_utc": 1460156860.0, "title": "AITA for not opening a card in front of my employer?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "I am a part time nanny/babysitter/housesitter for a family and I have been working for them for almost a year now.

That is the extent of me being an asshole in this post. I hope you'll agree.\n\nLast week I was invited to an event, a dance, by my ex's roommate. I broke up with my ex two months ago after about a month of fighting about me being insensitive and her being too sensitive. On top of that she wouldn't really participate with me in the things I thought interested us anymore. This was all exacerbated by my leaving the country and her having pregnancy scare. Regardless, we break up because I thought she didn't care much anymore. But she cried so immediately I regretted it.\n\nA week after that we go out for coffee and I tell her I want to get back together. She tells me we need time and not to get my hopes up. I don't give it time. The amount of fury in my head forces me to start an argument. And so a relatively civil break up turns into a post break up fight. As per usual with me. We aren't friends, we don't really talk. There's a major coldness between us that I now wish wasn't there. I asked if we had a chance and she said she didn't think there were romantic feelings between us anymore. I told her I wanted to reconcile the friendship. I understand how she doesn't believe me.\n\n\nSo the question is this. It's been two months since we broke up and I'm seeing someone new. The new girl knows the situation completely. My ex isn't seeing anyone of course. She's a very innocent girl I think and she won't date someone she doesn't have an extreme connection with. I invite the new girl to the dance and honestly I wasn't expecting my ex to be there but I knew it was possible. \n\nShe shows up. I didn't totally expect her to. Like I said one of the reasons we broke up is that she would never get out with me. We even dance. She's says something critical about me. I try to be normal with minimal success because we even get into a minor argument there. It wasn't about the relationship but I could tell there was some bad blood between us. I left early with the new girl and I felt extremely rude about it. I don't know if my ex even saw us leave together but I know how bad I would feel to watch my ex leave with another guy. Like I said it just doesn't seem like she would care anyway. It wasn't to make her jealous that I brought the new girl in the first place, but by the end of the night I wanted nothing more than for my ex to see me leave with her.

It's a shitty situation and we're trying to get our stuff together to move out. Also, I admit that I'm an alcoholic, which is part of what got us into this situation in the first place. I go on these crazy binges every few months where I turn into a complete bitch and argue with everyone. It sucks for everyone in the house, and my neighbors too. I have been trying to get help for this problem, in the form of outpatient group therapy. My most recent binge was one of the worst I've ever had, because of the consequences for others.\n\n\nOn my most recent binge (this was only about 2 weeks ago so these events are still fresh), I ended up getting hauled off by police to the county mental hospital. I blame my dad for this, for a few reasons. First of all, my dad initiated the physical violence. He also for some reason told the police that my boyfriend was growing pot in our closet, (he never has), resulting in him being beaten up by the cops, getting searched, and the police tearing our room apart looking for imaginary pot plants. In this whole situation, honestly, I think it was my boyfriend who got fucked the worst. My dad hates the guy for not having a \"real\" job, even though he's been supporting us by working (from home) as a graphic designer and web developer.\n\n\nSo, in a nutshell, because my dad lied to the police, my boyfriend got beaten by cops for no damn reason, I was publicly humiliated (I was in my underwear when they threw me in the back of the car; I wasn't allowed to put my clothes on), I spent 3 days in the county mental hospital on a 5150 hold, my boyfriend was beaten up and his rights were SEVERELY violated, and now I have an elder abuse complaint on my record. Oh, and I also have nerve damage in my right thumb because of the handcuffs (good thing I'm a lefty). I do have evidence of the fight between my dad and me (many bruises from him grabbing my arms, knocking me on the ground, and sitting on me until the cops arrived), so if it ever comes to it I have a leg to stand on in court.\n\nSo people of Reddit, my question to you is this: am I the asshole for resenting and partly blaming my dad for this situation? I acknowledge that I was the one who was drinking, and my dad probably thought he was helping by getting me into the mental hospital. Maybe he did think we were growing pot, idk, but I think he just made that up to hurt my boyfriend because he dislikes him (dad can be passive-aggressive like that). All in all, I just feel completely violated by all this, and I no longer trust my father at all. What do you guys think? Am I right to mistrust my father? Am I the asshole for bringing this situation on in the first place?\n\nEdited because of bad writing and improper formatting.", "score": 11, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4eyjqc", "name": "t3_4eyjqc", "created_utc": 1460750724.0, "title": "AITA for sending 2 high school students to juvie?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "All right, so this whole situation started a couple days ago. \n\n(I'll be using fake names)\n\nOne of my friends got a video that was sent from a sophomore at the local high school named Dylan. The video showed Dylan and his friend Henry throwing a live chicken in a bonfire and proceeded to dump gasoline all over this live chicken and use a pitchfork to beat the chicken when it jumped out of the fire. The whole time throughout the video, they were laughing hysterically and enjoying it. I have also been told they've killed 5 other chickens but only recorded 1. \n\nThe video was posted in a Kik group chat that had 12 people in it. The video pissed me the fuck off.

That story is a little cloudy and don't have information on it. Dylan was psychotic and I feared that he would progress into something more dangerous. I wanted consequences for this kid, and I wanted him to regret what he did\n\nI decided to create an anonymous twitter account and post the video on it and tag people from the school on it. Each day, it got more popular and more people were talking about. Today, it got the most notice. I had over 50 notifications of people messaging me, retweeting it, commenting on it.

I go out and say \"Hi, how are you\" etc and she looks straight through me and then barks \"get in the car then\" to my girlfriend. We look at each other like \"okay, what is this about\" and then they go and I get back to work.\n\nI'd only met L once before, we went out to dinner as part of a big group and I didn't get much chance to speak to her but she seemed alright?\n\nAnyway the evening comes and all of my girlfriend's friends show up. We're playing cards and drinking and I keep trying to get L involved in the conversation since she's basically sitting there sulking. We end up playing some drinking game, which I lose so I have to down a *lot* of skittles vodka.\n\nThis soon necessitates a trip to the bathroom. I stagger there and L is in there with the door open, fixing her makeup. I can't remember what was said but she told everyone I told her to fuck off. It doesn't seem out of character.\n\nAnyway I sort myself out and then go to the bedroom where the girlfriend is trying to decide what shoes to wear. She selects a pair and then goes back to tell everyone else she's ready, should we call taxis etc. The flat is empty.\n\nWe don't think much of it and head out to the club anyway. They're all there and a couple of them (not L) buy us drinks. Girlfriend asks if we can go somewhere a bit more private after a bit of dancing around with some of her mates. She proposes to me (I was very surprised! but it was the weekend of the leap day so I guess okay?) and I say yes...we have more drinks to celebrate and then get a takeaway and wander home. We ran into a few of her friends in Subway but they were being weird and we were buzzing so we left them to it.\n\nSo that was nearly two months ago now and L still won't talk to my girlfriend apparently because I told her to fuck off? Now fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks L won't come to our wedding in the summer and she's worried everyone else will side with L who apparently has a reputation as a bit of a drama queen. I offered to contact L somehow and try and apologise but I'm told it would do more harm than good.\n\nBut anyway, according to my fianc\u00e9e's friends, I'm an asshole.

I have been married for  coming up on five years. My husband is great, he does a lot of really good things for me, but he has never held a job longer than 6 months. He gets bored or frustrated and jumps ship, often without having lined up another job first. The problem is he's very smart and very charismatic and knows he can easily land a new job so he's just fallen into this habit where he assumes he'll never have problems getting another job. He also gets waaaaay too enthused at the start of the job and basically throws all his energy into that honeymoon period. Then he gets worn out, bored, disappointed and quits.\n\nFor example, at this latest job he was brought in as an assistant manager and promised his own store within 3 months. He would come in early, stay late, volunteer to work on his days off, etc and most pay periods he was racking up 80 hours per week. He's salaried, so he's not seeing a dime of over time. On top of that his coworkers are kind of assholes, they consistently show up late, call out, make basic mistakes, etc. So I get it, his job is super shitty. The company just offered him his own store and he put in his two weeks notice - before he even had an interview lined up else where. Now he's starting a new job in a business he'd already tried once before.\n\n\nI've gotten on his case about this several times before in the past, and pointed out to him that there is no consistency here, we can't plan for our retirement like this, I can't go back to school if he's not working, blah blah blah. I hate listening to myself harp on him because I do understand his job sucks - I really don't want to be that bitch wife who's making coming home after a stressful day at work even more stressful. On the other hand I am stressing the fuck out. I have never worked a job for any less than three years. I am miserable in my current job, it's no where close to the industry I want to be in. I am struggling to motivate myself to go into work, but I still have to because I know I can't count on his job and I'm not qualified to go and get a different job elsewhere because I don't have a degree. I constantly feel like I'm getting shafted because he just flits from job to job. I honestly really resent him for this.\n\n\nThere's a lot of other factors playing into this situation as well. I have an expensive hobby that I usually keep myself amused with - he does not. I have taken several weekend trips because of my hobby, he has not. He's made a couple of big ticket purchases without consulting me that I' freaked out over (and admittedly did not handle well at the time of). No body is innocent here.\n\n\nAnyways I feel like a colossal asshole for getting on him about the job situation all the time and for telling him that I think I'm getting the raw end of the deal - he gets to quit his job whenever, but I don't. It's fine if I'm overreacting, I'd just like to stop second guessing myself, I don't have the energy to battle myself and battle him all the time.", "score": 36, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4g1jep", "name": "t3_4g1jep", "created_utc": 1461375540.0, "title": "amitheasshole for wanting my flatmates boyfriend to pay rent?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "4g1kro", "name": "t3_4g1kro", "created_utc": 1461376188.0, "title": "AITA For wanting my flatmates boyfriend to pay rent?", "link_flair_text": "too close to call", "selftext": "AITA \nSo there are four of us who live in a four bedroom flat, three guys and one girls.

My town has two gyms in it. A YMCA and a Snap. The Snap doesn't have a squat rack so I have a YMCA membership. Anyway in about late November this older dude, upper 20s if I'm not mistaken, really just started being a giant dick. Our first encounter was him approaching me to explain how I was incorrectly and how he could do it better by leaning backwards and arcing his back. Later that day I see him doing Lat Pull downs and he is doing quarter reps. So I ask him why he isn't doing the full motion, being curious due to being a novice in the gym. His reaction was to tell me to fuck off and not speak to him again. It legitimately escalated immediately to that. Eventually time passed and one day my training partner and I were doing leg press and had our water bottles next to it. Like most people, as observed and I would assume, we stand next to it when we where waiting on the other one. He comes into the gym and goes to the dead lift platform, which is next to the leg press. After a set I go to stand up and see that he is walking towards me, I assume he is going to get some weights, so I begin to walk out of the narrow aisle so I can stay out of his way. As I am doing so, without adequate time to fully remove myself, he insists on yelling \"Get the fuck out of my way\". I just think this is his way of fulfilling whatever grudge he has against me. Sorry for asking why you were doing a movement a certain way, one time, after you critiqued me. Any way his fit was followed by him preceding to go over and tell a guy right behind me, while I had a headphone slightly off my ear, that when I left the gym he was going to fight me and jump me in the parking lot. Now being in what I thought was a \"Christian Family Facility\" as I walked out that night I thought the appropriate thing to do is to tell the front desk, hey, pretty sure somethings about to go down. They tell me to go see the administrator and I tell him the above story and he walks outside with me as I leave. Nice of him I suppose. Anyway within the next few days he approaches me and says he talked to the guy. Then he proceeds to tell me that everything has been taken care of and if anything happens again just to come see him. After a few days I walk into the gym and as I walk by a mirror like any sane bodybuilder I look in it and slightly flex my tricep. He, standing in the squat rack that has view of the mirror decides to once again scream \"Don't fucking look at me\". I just kind of shrug this off and think hey, he's kinda mad I talked to the admin about him. This will probably be a one time thing. After it occurs around 5 more times I go and see the administrator about after he did it when my grill was with me. Same procedure goes by as last time. There was one minor difference. The admin told me not to look at him, or in mirrors that he can also be seen in. This kinda irritates me but whatever. Time passes. Sometimes he is kinda in my view, or I'm walking from place to place in the gym and in such instances it is hard not to look in his general direction. He uses these opportunities to shout his remarks once again, \"Don't fucking look at me\", throwing in the occasional motherfucker on the end. Being a rather passive person I let this occur a number of times but one day, after having a rather shitty day, he did it. So I told the administrator again. I am met with the same response as last time. Everything should be good, just don't look at him. Well Saturday I am at the gym. I am talking to a friend who I haven't seen in a while who was recently hospitalized and was just in town for the weekend seeing family. Anyway, previously that week I had attempted to PR on Bench. I got 240 for a single and had failed in my attempt at 250. So I was talking about it. Anyway the gentleman previously mentioned, you know the one who had repeated been an ass at the gym, over hears me and decides to begin shit talking me to a group of five or so people, rather loudly. My response as it has been a countless numbers of time was to ignore the problem and go about my day. Anyway as history seems to repeat it self today, I was at the gym, I had finished my workout and had decided instead of doing cardio on a bike for 10-20 minutes, since I had some free time and had friends playing, I may as well play basketball for an hour or so. The nature of the gym is that the weight area is visible from the basketball course and vice versa. After playing for about and hour I feel as if somebody is looking at me and I glance up. He and about four people are looking in my direction and then he proceeds to point. I think lets just shrug it off. This is followed by somebody coming downstairs to inform me that for roughly thirty minutes he has been talking shit on me. Once again shrug it off. An hour passes, I'm still playing basketball. Because to be honest I'm having fun and don't worry I had 25g of protein immediately after lifting and then ate two peanut butter sandwiches after a game of basketball. I felt like I was being looked at again so I glance over again. This time its him a two other people. This has honestly pushed my to my limit. I live in a rather small town and my parental figures have been informed of all of this previously. When I got home though I went to my father and gave him my plan. It was to go to the administrator tomorrow and talk to him again. If any altercation occured I would let his superiors know. Well my father decides to inform me that after the last incident he told numerous board members about it. Well that was followed by him and I going to see multiple board members.\n\nHonestly this situation is rather stupid in my opinion. Everybody in the gym has a like purpose, to improve themselves in some nature. The environment should thus be positive and people should support one another. In this gym I have NEVER felt that. It is filled with negativity and hatefulness. People frequently put down others. The small things are easy to overlook because in the big scheme of things they don't matter. This gentleman's repetitive nature of consistently negatively impacting others seems different to me though.\n\nAll in all I really want to know if I took the right steps? Am I The Asshole of the situation by telling the administrator? What could I have done differently, I want to learn in case of future conflict?

If anything it happened several years back but it's tearing my family apart, my sister holds a grudge over it still and it's been stopping me from repairing relationships damaged over the incident. \n\nOkay, so brief bit of backstory. My mum died when I was 10, so a year later my dad took my brother and I to a support group for families affected by lost loved ones. We met my dad's new wife to be and her daughter, who was the same age as me. Over time they became close, and my brother and I bonded with our soon-to-be step-sister to the point of sleeping on her floor after nightly Star Wars Battlefront sessions. \n\nAbout a year later, my dad remarried and they moved in with us. My best friend took a liking to my step-sister, and she was interested in him. Because they were both shy (first relationship and all), I helped them coordinate a relationship for a while. My step-sister and I became good friends to the point of me considering her just a plain sister, even though I didn't (and I guess still don't) see my step-mother as a real mother to me. My friend and my sister broke up over something stupid, and she harboured some resentment towards me for a couple weeks as I tried to say he wasn't a complete asshole, but she eventually forgave me. \n\nFast forward another year, and we're in secondary school (uhhh middle school for you guys state-side? 12/13yr old anyway). My friend group and her friend group are pretty tight at this point, albeit with some awkwardness between my sister and I sharing friends (and her dislike for my BFF/her ex). We still spend most of our breaks (recess) playing football (soccer) on the field, whilst she and her friends reside in the lunch room gossiping and joking. Occasionally my BFFs (the ex and another guy) would leave our group to go chat up girls from her group (the ex would chat up one of my sister's friends, and the other BFF would try to flirt with my sister with some success). \n\nOne day as my group was walking across the playground to grab something from the lunchroom, my two friends came storming over. They had just been with my sister's group as usual, and looked livid. Apparently my sister had been extremely aggressive and rude to the pair of them without any provocation (later corroborated by *her* friends). They asked \"Why is she being such a massive bitch? Is she just like that?\". I kind of panicked, wondering what I should say, but overall I didn't want people to think my sister was a bad person. Somewhat selfishly I also had been hoping my other BFF and my sister would get together at some point (due to similar interests and affection shared between the two), so that also factored in to me not wanting my sister to be known as an \"explosive bitch\". \n\nI suggested that it was \"probably (my sister)'s time of the month, like hormones or something. She's not a bad person\". The group calmed down and talked amongst themselves, as some began whispering and giggling about the idea of my sister having a period (immature kids starting puberty and all). I told them to shut up and we went on with our day. Now, bear in mind that I was a 12 year old kid who had barely begun to learn about puberty and female hormonal changes, so it was the first thing that came to mind as to why she was acting odd. I also thought it was okay, as it was part of a normal bodily process that all women go through. \n\nGot home, and my dad had a go at me for making my sister upset. Apparently I had been spreading rumors about her, which embarrassed her. I apologised and explained the situation which he accepted but said I should tell *her* that. She refused to talk to me, and instead ignored me for the next 5 years (literally, she would only talk to me on rare Christmases when she *had* to). \n\nThe \"rumor\" was only between my group and hers, and literally disappeared within a week (my friends were like goldfish, forgot about it once they heard the new canteen burgers had mayo as standard). If anything it improved my friends views towards her, and my other BFF even suggested they should go out some time. \n\nSide note, that didn't work out because while she was considering it, she told me to go away and pushed me backwards down the stairs (I still believe as an accident) and said I'd never achieve anything. My friend heard about this, and stormed up to her criticising her actions before calling her a cunt, and storming off (the moment she swore a lifelong grudge against my BFFs). \n\nPoint is, she still refuses to talk to me, even attempted to convince her fiance (fiancee? I dunno) that I'm bad, even though he and I get on alright. I can sort of understand her hatred for my friends (one broke up with her over Runescape and later flirted with her friends, the other won her heart before defending me and called her a cunt). But I don't get why she still bears a grudge against me. I've been trying to make amends. I always talk to her politely if I have to talk to her, I say nothing but good things about her (even defending her actions when talking to my friends), and *always* buy her birthday and christmas presents that I put a ton of thought into. \n\nShe hasn't invited me to her wedding, a lot of my old friends that also were friends with her refuse to talk to me (those that do are rude and dismissive), and at this point it just hurts me tremendously.

The 4 of us get along fairly well and are fairly similar in living situations: similar incomes (they're about 10% higher than us), living in the city, and both dual-income households. The key differences being we have no children (our friends have one), and we live in an apartment whereas they live in a condo (unknown whether they rent or purchased).\n\nMy wife was going through Facebook yesterday and commented that our friends got a new vehicle. I was initially happy for them, since one of their vehicles had been giving them problems (they have 2 - a 2005 model wagon and a 2012 model sedan). Shortly thereafter I came across the same posts in my FB feed. Turns out they traded in the 2012 model for a **new** (as in, 0 miles on odometer) 2016 model SUV. The 2005 model is still in their possession.\n\nPretty much by reflex I blurted out, \"well that was stupid. Hope they enjoy their depreciation\", in reference to the fact that [new vehicles lose on average 20% of their value as soon as they're driven off the lot](http://www.carfax.com/guides/buying-used/what-to-consider/car-depreciation). It is because of this that my wife and I have always bought used vehicles, and paid for them with cash.\n\nMy wife's reaction was just a statement about how saying stuff like that will guarantee a loss of already dwindling friends (oh the joys of being in your 30s). In my defense, what triggered **my** statement wasn't so much the fact that they financed a vehicle (we personally refrain from financing anything if we're able to), but rather that they did such on a **new** one when they already had one that was still low mileage and working just fine. I've been reflecting on my reaction ever since my wife responded to it.\n\nI mean they seem really happy and excited about it, but I don't think they realize how much of it's value they're going to lose over the next few years.

Thanks for your help.  I'll be happy to answer any further information questions.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I are coming up on our anniversary.  We always plan surprises for each other for these things.  He's planning something this year.  Tonight he was asking me how far he could drive my car for something anniversary related.  Here's some background on that.\n\nWe've been living together for two years.  Also in the past two years, people have hit my car four times.  One of these was sometime earlier today while it was parked.  Not serious damage, but I'm dreading dealing with it.  I'm assuming it's between 300-500 dollars in damage.  One of those hits resulted in my last car being totaled.  I'm a college student, so my single mother has had to absorb the costs of those issues.  It's been pretty stressful for us.\n\nAnyway, he wants to drive my car for the surprise.  I told him he can't drive my car for longer than 30 minutes, especially since my mom is going to be pretty upset about this latest incident.  He doesn't have a car since we live in a city.  \n\nHe was vague about how far it was, giving me estimates for as short as an hour to as long as fifteen hours.  He was being cutesy about it, so he wasn't being a jerk or intentionally misleading, just trying to keep it vague for the surprise.  After this latest issue, I just don't feel comfortable with taking any risks.  I wasn't sure how my insurance would treat an accident if someone else was driving my vehicle.  Partway through the conversation, I told him I'd have to check my insurance policy on it.  \n\nHe was very pushy about driving my car to do this.  I felt it was pretty reasonable for me to be uncomfortable with all things considered.  I just wish he would have considered my feelings and anxieties on the matter, an issue we've talked about at length before, also somewhat recently, but I didn't bring up this time.\n\nAm I being unreasonable?  He was saying I'm being paranoid.  I just don't feel my family can deal with any more stressors, and he's not an insured motorist because he doesn't have a car.  Is that fair, or is it paranoid?  Am I being an asshole for being touchy about this?\n\nThis is a pretty typical issue between us.  Me being \"paranoid,\" him being \"rational.\"  \n\nI got pretty pissed at one point and brought that up, so he got upset and stopped wanting to talk to me.  I told him essentially that he uses \"rational\" as a front to get what he wants.  I said he puts down other people's views as irrational and says his are more rational, but they're not, it's just a tool.  I mean, I'd have to write a book about us to communicate our sides on that.  Anyway, that's what I said.  Maybe it's a pretty asshole thing to say.\n\nAlso, for a point of reference, all of the reasons I gave in here he heard as well.\n\nI feel bad because he was excited about this and certainly wanted it to be a positive thing, but I felt he went through with it thoughtlessly and without considering a ton of things he should be completely aware of.  So when I started to reject his ideas, things got messy, he started stone-walling me.  But maybe I am just being paranoid and shitty about it.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

She visits me at school every other weekend, we text/call all the time, love hanging out with her etc. \n\nThe ~second time she's visiting someone's blowing up her phone like all weekend, a text or a call every 5-10 minutes most of which she isn't even responding to. Naturally curious I ask who it is and she tells me it's her ex...who's also her manager at work(important to note). \n\nThey had been long time friends through family, were together for maybe a year or two, and had broken it off roughly a year before we'd gotten together. Let's call him Craig. Her Craig started working at the same place at the same time, both had a chance at management but she declined because made more off tips than what management would've payed or something like that. We had talked about him before that day because she wanted to know if how I felt that they were still cool, to which I said sure; she likes me plenty so I didn't feel insecure about it , and if they were friends before it seemed like they should friends after being together unless it was a bad break up or something. whatevs.\n\nSo I see some of the text Craig's sending while me and her are just chilling. It started off with him being salty about her switching shifts or something to come see me and had devolved into  salty rambling about her coming to see me, how she's so ungrateful, etc. super jealous stuff about us being together. Shit goes on literally all day, we woke up to her phone going off every minute or so and only slept after she finally put her phone on silent and stopped replying all together. She hardly pays it any mind and neither do I. Most of his ramblings go unread by the both of us.\n\nA couple of conversations with her about her ex's in general (why they broke up, etc.) and we get to Craig. Come to find out, from what she tells me, dude's a fucking mess. Alcoholic, not in school, gets in fights all the time,  **abusive**, etc. Makes me even less worried than I ever was that she might be interested in him, but abusive sticks out. She tells me a story about how he choked her out once and she thought she was going to die...so of course I'm thinking \"why are you even civil with this dude anymore?\" but I just leave it at half jokingly telling her I better not ever met him and I drop it.\n\nA month  goes by and then there's a sudden, uncharacteristic silence from her. No phone calls from her, barely answering texts and taking way longer than usual to do so, doesn't want to visit, nothing for like 3 weeks. I ask what's wrong, all I get is that she's going through some stuff and doesn't feel like talking but won't give any more detail than that, ok. Can't really do anything other keep trying to talk to her and try to make her feel better or see if there's anything I can do to help, so that's all I do.\n\nShe slowly gets back to normal communicating, visits etc. but I'm still bothered by this (almost) month of silence on top of several other things stressing me out that could fill another AITA post this long. Super long story short, after having a small mental breakdown she tells me she was raped by an ex, doesn't say who and I don't even think to ask in the moment. I'm caught off guard trying to think of what to say or do or how to feel etc. She tells me she only told me because I was so worried about her and not knowing what happened and that if it wasn't for that she wasn't planning to tell anybody. The whole thing raised a bunch of emotions and questions that I knew I either couldn't have or that she really didn't want to answer about it, I kinda just sat mostly in silence for a while before going back to talking about what else was bothering me.\n\n\nFast Forward some weeks, I still have no more details about it other than it happened with ...some ex and that she doesn't want to talk about it. I only make it effort to bring it up once in a relevant argument about something else, but other just give her space to talk about it if and when she feels like it. \n\nBut then we're hanging out one day with her family, I'm dicking around on her phone on IG or something when she get's a text from a number with no name that says \"how's your day going?\". I ask who's the number, she says it's Craig... idk why it all clicked in that moment but it did so I ask her later what ex she was referring to about the rape thing. Of fucking course it was Craig. So not only does she have to see and put with him at work and has been doing so since it happened 2-3 months ago, but he's still blowing up her phone talking telling her she wanted it etc. and she still just doesn't want to talk about it. I tell her I wish she'd call the cops , tell hr, at least block the niggas number...anything? and she's still just saying she doesn't want to talk about it, \"you don't just tell people you got raped\" , telling me I should just forget about it and move on etc. . And I get that but am I crazy for wanting literally anything to be done right now other than her suggestion of just pretending it didn't happen? I could understand if it was it was some random unknown person you'd never see again in some alley etc. but I don't understand how she's ever going actually to get over this with him constantly being a  reminder of the incident and I really (hopefully understandably) don't feel comfortable with her being forced to being around and in contact with him all the time and I don't see how she could feel any different.  \n\n\n**TL;DR : Girlfriend was raped by an ex with a history abusive behavior, who's still harassing her and who she has to see at work on a regular basis. Am I crazy that I want something done about this? That I'm not ok just pretending that nothing happened like she seems to want to do? Am I pressing her about this too much?

Now that I am out of college for the summer, she's asking me more often to take her places. AITA for not wanting to? I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\n\nEDIT:\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \n\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it.

Sometimes she locks herself out and texts me, but besides that she will always rudely avoid me. I'm not really sure what her deal is about me, I have stayed out of her way pretty much the whole year. Buut, last night she texted me the longest, most dramatic text about something really insignificant that happened earlier that day. Obviously some rage or tension has been building up and she chose a really dumb situation to pour it all out. The next day I tried calling her to see if she was okay and have a conversation about the tension, but she denied the call. I then texted her and tried express how I was feeling, and that I was concerned about all the rage coming out at once. Unfortunately, though, instead of having a real human conversation, she just answered in very short texts like \"Got it\" or \"Yep, I agree.\" I was really frustrated about this, especially since getting those long explosive texts gives me really intense anxiety. I feel like I'm getting a heart attack every time someone texts me something dramatic. So, in an effort to maybe have a real conversation, I decided to block her number. If she asks, I'll explain why I did it. Its rude of me to block the number, but its also rude to completely ignore my existence. The thing is, I'm not sure if this is furthering the hole of passive agressiveness. What if she gets locked out, or if there's an emergency?

It's a cover band with a brass section that gives it a bit of an edge. Friend number one, (Tim) has been a member since the beginning, originally the drummer now a trumpet player. He recruited friend number two (Mike) sometime ago as the new drummer. Many people have come and gone in this band by their own choice but this is the first time someone has been kicked.\n\nThe Story:\n\nSo, Tim has been kicked from the band by the lead singer (Sean) (also an original member) and by Mike (who does the majority of the behind the scenes work with organising dates and moving gear etc). He has been kicked as he wishes to pick and choose which gigs he shows up for and which practice sessions he shows up for. Basically he wants to show up as he pleases so as to make money. Last summer Tim was given \u20ac500 by the band so that he may pursue marching band aspirations in the states (we're Irish). This was a gift from the band and he proceeded to spend this money on a brand new iPod, so, did he really have to accept this money? Not only this but he has lied constantly when not showing up for gigs  (found by other band members in nightclubs when he was meant to be playing that night etc).\n\n\nWhen Mike and the Sean came to him with the problem he tried to pull rank on Mike despite the fact that Tim does no work but playing on the night, when the rest of the band is setting up gear he drinks at the bar. I'm not even in the band and I help set up when I'm around.\n\n\nAdding to this, once Tim had been kicked he decided to call his relatives who work in the tax office and is reporting Sean for not having paid taxes on any of his music ventures. This obviously effects everyone in the band. Even if he does not follow through its still a threat and he has claimed the others are not his friends yet he makes threats like these. \n\n\nMain points:\n\n\n1. Mike & Tim both in band.\n2. Tim and Sean are original members, Mike is not\n3. Tim wishes to pick and chooses when he shows up and to do as little work as possible.\n4. Mike does the majority of the behind the scenes work.\n5. Tim received \u20ac500 from band to pursue marching band aspirations in states. He then spent this money on an iPod, an unnecessary purchase.\n6. Tim pulled rank on Mike, Tim being an original member.\n7. Sean chooses to kick Tim as he, Mike, and everyone else in the band agrees his behaviour is unacceptable. \n8. Tim threatens to report Sean (and thus the rest of the members) to the Tax Offices.\n\n\nIf I can think of any more details I'll add them and I'll try answer all questions.

I legitimately do and even with the good non-materialistic things that happen to me, at first i feel so happy, then a deep sadness that im a fraud. Also i realised i dont want anything physical to be associated with her. Any gift, from the past couple of years especially, i felt odd about it, very uneasy... Now i realise its because her hurtful actions towards me dont match the nice things she buys. Sometimes its something ive been wanting for years, other times its just to 'flash'. Most expensive thing has been around \u00a3200 - some jewellery. Thats still a lot to me. \n\nRecently ive uncovered this anger towards my mother, provoked my fresh arguments. And i have moved is anger onto her gifts, i look at them and they disgust me. Like they carry all her weird negative emotions towards me... I feel like an ass about this though... Ive been wanting to get rid of them.... I can't give them back because she will flip... Maybe sell what i can sell? Or am i over-reacting and this will pass? Though i must say, ive been feeling like this for years, only then it was more guilt based and now its just anger and disgust", "score": 6, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4k5tyi", "name": "t3_4k5tyi", "created_utc": 1463707082.0, "title": "AITA for getting ready for prom without my friend?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "comments": [{"id": "d3ddjxa", "body": "NTA.

This thought has been lingering on my mind and I just recently found this subreddit. Everyone here seems cool and level headed so it seems like a great place to ask for an opinion.\n\nSo we begin with the cousin backstory. We aren't blood related (more like a step cousin) and I met her in my early teens. The moment I saw her I fell for her and was a little confused and shocked when I learned that she was my cousin shortly after our meeting. My heart wasn't having it though and I ended up keeping that crush on her for about 5 years. I made several plans to confess my strange affection but I always pussied out but that never stopped me from becoming hulk mode whenever she brought her boyfriend at the time around. I definitely wouldn't have to ask y'alls opinion on THAT one! I know I was the asshole! Anyway during the 5th year of my crush on her, She moved in with my family and I realized the difficulties and our incompatibilities of our \"potential\" relationship and I finally gave up. I no longer share romantic feelings with her but I still feel protective of her.\n\nNow for my friend. We have been friends since elementary school. We used to hangout a lot and we were cool. In our younger years, we were kind of assholey to each other but what kids weren't? As we grew older, we grew more mature and our friendship did as well. While it did seem he was always trying to one up me, we still were close. During year 3 of my crush, I told him about my feelings towards my cousin. He didn't treat me like a freak or make fun of me. He received and acted very well\u2026that is until time wore on. Its worth mentioning that year 3 was the year that my friend and cousin met so it made sense that I told him. Also worth mentioning that my  cousin was with a guy at this time. My friend started acting flirtacious with my cousin and it was pissing me off. She was my crush so I thought it was messed up. She expressed to me that it made her uncomfortable that he tried so hard and even said that SHE DIDNT LIKE HIM AND THAT HE WASN'T ATTRACTIVE (remember this. Obvious saltiness, sorry). So a few times I have had to pull him aside to tell him to cool it, which he would for awhile but then he would start with his shenanigans again. By the third time I had it so I told him to stop because I was in love with her and I felt like he was stepping on my toes. FINALLY he officially cooled it\u2026for about a year and a half.\n\nTime marches on. A little after 5th year and my cousin is single, I have no romantic feelings for her, and my friend is lurking. My cousin's birthday rolls around and we have a party which my friend is invited to. At said party, he got extra gutsy with his old tactics. He got more touchy feelie and even put his hands on her waist. Me being protective and testosterone etc, I was pissed. I saw it as him disrespecting my previous feelings and trying to one up me. After the party, I pulled my cousin aside and decided to spill my guts about how I use to feel about her so that she could understand my previous assholery towards her ex as well so she could understand that I believed my friend was trying to one up me and vent about his dickishness. Her reaction to my previous romantic feelings? She said it was weird but that its in the past and that she's ok with it. Her reaction to my friend? She confesses that she has had a crush on him for a long time. Well fuck. Isn't it such a sad irony that the same convo I confess my old feelings to her was the same she confess her long time feelings for my friend (or even frienemie at this point)? Younger me would be devastated. Current me wanted to be the bigger man though. Knowing that she had feelings and that my friend most likely does to, it would be dickish of me to not tell her that he probably liked her. So I did. Then with her blessing, I told my friend that she likes him (without mentioning that she knows about my old feelings). Then they got together to no one's surprise (apparently I wasn't crazy, everyone thought they liked each other), I had to endure the \"Are you ok with this?\" question from those who knew of my old feelings (about 2 or 3 people) and from everyone else who thought the idea was kinda messed up for the plain fact that he is my longtime friend and she is my cousin. I don't like them together. I can even say I hate it. I cringe when I see them together. I hate seeing photos of them on social media and seeing the stupid cutesy shit they post on each others shit. I hate it. In the beginning of their relationship, they asked me to third wheel a few times but I always refused which earned me \"you're a bad friend\" comments from my cousin (frustrated and ragey sigh). Every time I think about it, I wonder if I made the right decision to set everything up the way I did. Worth mentioning, right before they became official, I told him how strict my parents were (since she lives with us) and how he will be treated differently. In typical fashion for him, he complained about the rules and was being a shit brain. Too many suspicious events happened and it caused the friend's family and my family to grow some tension towards each other and for me to give him the same treatment my cousin's ex boyfriend used to get from me (except turned down a few notches). I wanted to fight him honestly. Of course I never tried to provoke one or challenge him but I would've relished the opportunity had it arose. It got to the point where I had a man to man with him and said \"we are no longer friends you are nothing but her boyfriend to me\" but he convinced me to start over. Things have gotten better from the parent's rule spectrum and we have been getting along \"better\" but I still feel that resentment. So after sitting through this long ass fucked up story, who is the asshole? I really wanna know if I made the right decision.", "score": 19, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4knv8m", "name": "t3_4knv8m", "created_utc": 1464009275.0, "title": "AITA for moving out of my brother's house?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "So at the beginning of May I(23) moved out of my brother's house because I became extremely unhappy living there.\n\nSo some backstory.

The incident in question happened a few months ago but it has been bugging me ever since so I thought I would submit it for your guys' judgment. \n\nI was boarding a very full plane and had an aisle seat. When I was almost to my row, I noticed a woman telling a man in my row that he was in her seat (window seat). He moved without a fuss, but proceeded to sit in my aisle seat. Once I reached the row, I tried to lte him know that I thought he was in the wrong seat. He got a bit upset and claimed that he had the aisle seat. Now at this point, I am getting a bit flustered as well because I really struggle in social situations and there are people waiting behind me to get to their seats in the back of the plane. To try and prove to him that he is in my seat and resolve the problem ASAP, I show him my boarding pass which clearly says 19C (aisle seat). However, he then continued to insist that the aisle seat is his. Eventually, a flight attendant comes over and I show her my ticket and she asks the man to move over a seat, which he does (albeit unhappily). I get and few glares from the people who had to wait behind me while he wouldn't let me in my seat, but at that time I felt that I was in the right. However, after we had both sat down I realized that because he was a rather large man, he might have wanted the window or aisle seat in order to not intrude on the personal space of the passengers on both sides of him. I offered to switch seats with him, but he refused. \n\nI felt bad about the whole situation the entire plane ride, especially since I am a very shy person so standing up for myself isn't really something I'm really used to and in this case standing up for myself made me feel like I had done the wrong thing.

My mother has complained for the last two years that my brother has never done any work, but I haven't had a first-hand account of this due to me being away at college. (I gave him the benefit of the doubt because my mom is mentally unstable and for other reasons that aren't necessary to disclose.)\n\nHowever, now that I'm home, all I see him do is play video games for hours on end-literally from the moment he gets up to the moment my mother comes home from work (a good 8-9 hours a day). He scrambles to finish 2-3 assignments per day to make it seem like he's working (in reality, this is a terrible strategy since he has 8 classes). He gets into these terrible anger fits when he can't play so nobody ever has stopped him until I came home. It doesn't help that I am (not can be, but am) a bossy cunt-I get pissed that he doesn't do his work and start ordering him around (totally my fault for losing my temper, I know).\n\nNow, fast forward to the past week or so-my brother needs to finish his work in the next two weeks or else he has to postpone something super important that has been planned since birth (almost out of the question to postpone). So my mom has started asking me to 'check' my brother's work-apparently I didn't catch the memo that this meant 'do' his work, and when I didn't comply (because that is cheating) she said (and I quote): \n\n\"You know what's cheating? Us giving you the money to take your GREs. Other kids out there have to work for that test and you just stole the money from us. You had an unfair advantage over those other kids. Now THAT'S real cheating.\"\n\nNaturally, I pulled a major bitch fit and spent five minutes almost yelling at her for various reasons, and stormed off. I guess she became apologetic because she tried to talk to me but I didn't respond (because no), and now she's pissed (my mother is currently at an atomic bomb level pissed). My brother is also mad at me because he thinks that diploma equals 'advanced tutoring'.

Definitely a dog person and this has been true forever.\n\nMy girlfriend (21) is about to move into an apartment with a friend. This friend owns a cat and it lives at the apartment. She's moving from her parents home where she currently has a cat and dog. Part of her decision to move was to be about fifteen minutes closer to school and to live with her friend, knowing this would mean seeing less of her pets and losing some space. She claims she has wanted this cat for a while but I haven't heard a word about it and I'm convinced that the new friend has sort of convinced her to get this new cat.\n\nWe talked (maybe even argued) about this on and off for almost 7 hours today while I was at work and now she's just worked up and upset that I'm not validating her feelings or understanding her point of view. So here I am trying to understand. We've been dating for a long time, she knows I'm not a cat person, we have some loose plans to move in together next fall, so any decision made now has to sort of consider that.  \n\nAs far as actual reasoning goes, this is what she has shared with me; she's worried if she doesnt get a cat now, she won't have the chance to later. She wants the other girls cat to have a friend. And that's it. Nothing about wanting something to take care of, come home to, or anything actually emotional or meaningful in my opinion. I don't see why she cant just enjoy having the extra time with her friend and the other cat and even see her own pets on weekends or whenever she wants to drive home. On top of that she's starting a new job and still has a year left of school so she has plenty to keep her occupied without having to take care of an animal. \n\nFeel free to ask questions but I'm working on getting to sleep soon so I may not answer until morning.

My wife and I have been looking for a new apartment to rent. We've only been looking for a couple of weeks. \n\nWe've saved up enough money to cover agents fee, a deposit and the first month's rent but we agreed that we would tell agents/landlords that we are looking to move in at the beginning of next month. We both get paid at the end of the month meaning we would have plenty left over ater fees for any appliances, furniture etc we needed after we moved.\n\nWe've seen about 5 apartments so far. A couple of them, we realised, were a little out of our price range. One or two were a bit too far away from our jobs and family.\n\nA few days ago, we viewed a gorgeous apartment that was well within our budget, was in a nice area, and was only 1 mile from where we work. Plus, the owner was a private landlord so there were no agents fees to pay.\n\nWe told the landlord we hoped to move in around the 1st July but we would pay the deposit there and then in order to secure the apartment. The landlord seemed to like us but said he had another couple arriving in an hour who wanted to view the apartment. He agreed to call us later that day to let us know if we had got the apartment.\n\nTrue to his word, the guy called us that evening to give us the news that unfortunately he had given the apartment to the other couple as were willing to move in the very next day.\n\nNow, where it gets tricky is that in the time between us viewing the apartment and the guy calling to give us the news my wife decided that she wanted to move in straight away and not in early July as we'd discussed. She insists she told me this but I cannot for the life of me remember that conversation. I am usually quite attentive so either my concentration lapsed or she told me when I was in another room. Or she thought she told but actually didn't.\n\nIt's been two days and she is still pissed because we should have taken the apartment straight away. She insists it's my fault because I \"didn't listen to her\".\n\nAm I in the wrong?

Because she specifically said \"alone\" and \"by myself\" a few times, and then she was going to pick another guy up to go to a bar. (A guy who was kinda odd towards her. We were in the mall one day, and he excitedly waved to her. On our way out she got a notification that he posted that he was with her at the mall. He was also always asking her to party or where the party is or to get high with him.)\n\nI messaged her that night/morning to ask if she got home alright, and she said yeah. I asked how the night went, and she said that she and Joe just hung out and drank.\n\nI asked how he was hanging out, drinking, and playing, and she said that he wasn't playing. He wasn't supposed to play that night.\n\nI told her it's really weird that she was insistent on needing to be alone and by herself then went out with another guy. And not only that but that she told me he was going to play but really wasn't going to play.\n\nNow, I've been told that I was being weird and overly jealous about this situation specifically because I told her, \"It seems weird that you said you needed to be alone and by yourself but then went out with another guy.\"\n\n(We've since broken up, and I talked to her about this specific situation. In our discussion she revealed that he was never supposed to play that night. He asked her if she wanted to go, she said yes, and she went and picked him up so they could go.

I hope you can help me. I feel like I should let you know a little background info. I have Aspergers and see things very much in black and white. I am married. I have five kids ranging between 12 and 1 year old. I work part-time. My coworker, Nala works full time. She is 23 with no kids. \n\nSo I guess the situation started a couple months ago. Nala mentioned in passing her mom told her she had a month to find a place of her own. She often talks about her mom not letting her have a key and her mom telling her she wants her to find a place to live. A month goes by and I find out through Facebook that her mom went out of town for the weekend and she has no where to go. I message her and say just come sleep on my couch for the weekend. She does. Sunday she goes back to her mom's house. \n\nTwo more weeks go by. Now her mom is not letting her in the house at all. I talk to my husband and we let tell her she can couch surf at our house. We are led to believe this will be a short term arrangement, after all she has supposedly been preparing to move from her mom's house. \n\nI allocate a drawer in the fridge for her, i begin putting some things together for her that we have around the house. A kitchen table, TV stand, pots, pans, cups, rugs, I even go to some yard sales and get some things for her. We have never asked her for any money for rent, or using our things, or eating our food. \n\nFour weeks go by. I let her know we have an out of trip coming up in two weeks. I let her know she will need to find somewhere to stay while we are gone for five days and the exact dates we will be gone. \n\nA week before our trip she goes and sees an apartment. She says she likes it but won't have the money for it till Friday (payday and day one of our trip). I let her know that sounds good, but just make sure she has arrangements in case anything falls through since I will be out of town. I also ask another co-worker if they will make sure she has a place to go and help her out while I am gone if she needs it.\n\nDay one of our trip comes. She texts and says she can't meet the apartment man that day. He works opposite shift of her. I respond can you meet him tomorrow? She says he could only meet her in the morning. She then says idk what I am going to do. I don't respond. I am States away. I figure she is OK for a couple days. She is off on the following day (day three of our trip). Surely the apartment man and she can find time to meet up. He wants money and she wants a place. I hear nothing else from her so I assume she is fine. She has a sister and grandparents in the area as well as the coworker who promised to make sure she wasn't sleeping in her car. \n\nWe return from our trip to three kids with a stomach bug. I am busy with family and tired from our trip. I don't hear anything from her so I assume she is OK. I was expecting her to return when we did. She did not return, text, or call.\n\nShe had mentioned the week before we left she felt like my husband was getting with her being there. I tell her honestly, he is a little annoyed. Not at her in particular, just its a difficult adjustment to not have your own space and that it kinda cuts into time he and I usually spend together when we get the kids in bed, but to please understand it's not her it would be the same with anyone staying for an extended period. She seems to understand. \n\nTwo days after we return from our trip is my first day back at work. I tell her I am sorry I haven't text her, the kids have been sick. She says it's  ok and we get busy at work (we work in a call center so we can't really talk when it's busy). \n\nThe following day she is off work and a different coworker Sara says to me that she has been telling herself and others at work how awkward it will be when I return to work and that apparently she stayed with the other coworker and their roommate asked her to leave (idk why). I also find out Sara believes she has been staying in her car in our work parking lot, because others have seen her in the lot late at night. \n\nI later see that she has made multiple passive aggressive posts on Facebook. Things like \"I guess you never really know someone.\" I am reasonably sure these are about me. \n\nI feel like I have gone above and beyond. I clearly let her know when I would be back. If she still needed to stay she was welcome to. But at the same time I feel like if it were me, I would have left work early or called out to make time to meet with the apartment guy. I feel like if I text or call her and invite her back I am enabling her but at the same time feel like if she needs help she should know I will help. \n\nAITA for not calling or texting and assuming she would reach out if she still needed help? AITA for not reaching out now? \n\nI want to clear the air with her we sit beside each other, but I am not sure how to proceed and just ignoring the situation will make it eat at my brain. \n\nThanks for your responses in advance.", "score": 14, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4nulm9", "name": "t3_4nulm9", "created_utc": 1465803383.0, "title": "AITA for not taking a shift at work back", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 48, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4nvvof", "name": "t3_4nvvof", "created_utc": 1465828278.0, "title": "AMITA for having an attitude with my Dad?", "link_flair_text": null, "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "comments": [], "label": {"YTA": 0, "NTA": 0, "ESH": 0, "NAH": 0}}, {"id": "4nwbjq", "name": "t3_4nwbjq", "created_utc": 1465833990.0, "title": "AITA for not wanting to spend $225 for a limo ride?", "link_flair_text": "not the a-hole", "selftext": "One of my best friends is having a bachelor party next weekend in NYC.

I don't have any money for a concert ticket because I spent my money on a season pass a few weeks prior to these plans.\n\n\n\nIn an iMessage group chat, the topic of how we were going to get there comes up. None of us can drive because we are all teenagers without licenses. We try our parents but none of them are willing to drive us there. An idea pops up in one of my friends head: Uber. Okay let's just use an Uber that could fit all six of us (expensive) to go to a place that is miles away from where we live (even more expensive.) Keep in mind this would be doubled because they were planning to take Uber to and from the amusement park. I ask them how they're going to pay for this Uber and whether there will be an Uber drive who will be willing to drive 6 kids to an amusement park for 2 hours. Especially when we leave it will be 10 pm at night. We needed a card for Uber anyway and everyone claimed they only carry cash. One girl, let's call her Dana, suggests that I pay for the Uber, using the fact that she remembers that I had one against me. I don't have much money in my debit card because what goes in there is basically allowance money and gift money. I tell her in private that I don't want to use my card. Dana replies with, \"Why Not?\" I told her if she had her own card she would understand. \n\n\nWell this private conversation with her gets screenshotted and sent to the group chat where we were making plans. So much for private messaging. Everyone is in the chat act offended and say \"exposed!!!!!!!\" They tell me that they're going to give me money so I can put it in my card before we go on the trip. But how are they so sure that what they will give me will cover their ride? And they aren't even considering the fact that it takes time out of my life to meet up with them, get the money, and deposit it in my bank. I tell them I don't want and they act upset. I know I'm the only one with a debit card but I just don't feel comfortable with using it for this. Sorry if this was confusing to read. Am I the asshole? \n\n\nTL;DR: Friends want me to use my card to pay for an expensive Uber ride that will carry 6 people and will be a 2 hour car ride. They reason that I'm the only one with a card in the group and that they're just going to pay me before hand so I can put it in the card before hand.", "score": 32, "comments": [], "label": null}, {"id": "4oa5ld", "name": "t3_4oa5ld", "created_utc": 1466030518.0, "title": "AITA for taking the pillow", "link_flair_text": "All assholes", "selftext": "Context: day one at a hotel and me and person T both have two pillows, person N has one.\n\nThe next night before we go to bed persons N and T both have two pillows, I now have one. \n\nI take peron N's second pillow as it must be the one I lost and it puts everyone back to how they were the night before.

We play in a band together and see each other regularly. Back in September he went off to school to become a band instrument repair guy. I had an old clarinet laying around and I thought \"hey, maybe he could use this to practice on.\" I let him take the clarinet with him so that he could use it as a practice instrument, something to mess up on or fix or whatever.\n\nHe kept the clarinet from September to May, his entire program, giving me updates here and there along the way. He would tell me this week they were doing pad work, that week they were working with whatever tools. One day he told me he needed to replace the pads and he could get them for a low amount, so I told him to get me an amount of what it would cost. He never got back to me.\n\nFlash forward to today, he texts me and says \"I have your clarinet, it will be $300 for the repairs.\" I kind of respond in jest, thinking he was messing around, to which responds he isn't kidding. His reasoning is that $300 was a third of what it would have cost had I brought it in to a shop.\n\nI'm between a rock and a hard place. Part of me thinks that, at the end of the day, I got a completely overhauled clarinet that is probably in pretty good shape. He performed a service on the instrument, and he should be compensated. Maybe I should have been more aggressive in knowing the price of everything. The other part thinks, he never quoted me any kind of number before doing the repairs. He just told me out of the blue what the cost is going to be. And, because he's a pretty good friend of mine, I feel obligated to pay. \n\nI agreed to pay $100 a month for the next three months. Today I asked him for a receipt, just so I could see exactly what he did that would constitute a $900 repair job. He replied saying we don't have to worry about a receipt because there are still some moldy pads that need to be replaced, but because he doesn't want to work on it anymore and I don't want him to work on it anymore, he would give the clarinet back to me with the repairs he's done free of charge.\n\nI had planned on getting some form of compensation for him. I was going to get him a video game he wanted and some cash, but not $300. I guess I want to know if I'm was the asshole for being reluctant to pay and wanting to see a receipt, or is he the asshole for dropping the number out of nowhere?

I am also a complete shut in loser, and I literally have  no friends. \n\nAnyway, so my parents and my therapist are great people, but they did something that has hurt me to my core. My parents have been struggling in their marriage ever since I was a small child, and probably before that. I have begged them for years to seek marriage counseling. Unfortunately, they chose my therapist to go and see. \n\nThe reason they did this was complicated, however it ultimately boils down to my father having trust issues, and he has known my therapist for about forty years. They have a professional relationship, and that is ultimately why I was recommended to her by him. \n\nNow, my therapist and my parents are my only social contacts. I am far too shy to say anything to anyone at school. I have a roster of mental health diagnoses, but among them is a pretty nasty case of social anxiety. \n\nAnyway, I feel betrayed by my therapist for not only meeting my parents, but the entirety of my social circle behind my back. I am considering firing her, despite liking her a lot, because my trust in her is fundamentally shaken by this. My parents are begging me not to, citing that I have grown a lot since seeing her, and that it would be tragic if I did indeed leave after this mistake. My parents insist that no therapy took place in this situation, but instead, the therapist said that she would counsel them only if I allowed it. I am totally not okay with that, since I live with my parents, and my therapist would not be seeing me for me if she also got information about my life (at least indirectly) from my parents. I think that is fundamentally a terrible idea. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I the asshole for wanting to fire my therapist?\n\nTL;DR: My therapist did a consultation job for my parents. She said that she would only give them marriage counseling if I was cool with it. I'm not cool with it. These three people are the entirety of my social circle, and I feel betrayed by my therapist for seeing my family behind my back.

I noticed she randomly started to never want to be intimate, always go out with her friends instead of spending any time with me, and just seem really uninterested and distant, which is super painful. She also started spending (a lot) more time than I was comfortable with with this other guy, sometimes just not coming home until the next day. I was pretty pissed.\n\nAnyway, her birthday rolls around and she has a party at our house. I fucking cannot stand her friends and I know this fucking guy is going to be there too. In the spirit of fairness in storytelling, she knows I hate them and always go out of my way to avoid spending time with them and will just ditch if they come around because fuck them.  They are all just such trash, I could go on. I begrudgingly take the night off to attend it, though I suck at hiding my emotions, so I'm fairly hostile to the guests. Not yelling or anything but a couple snarky comments and a very rude exit (I'm not going to pretend I handled it well).  I just go to bed early. \n\nI wake up and she's gone and won't respond to texts. Finally at 1pm she shows up in that guys car. We get in a big fight and go on a \"break\" for a week in which she basically refuses to talk to me , because apparently the silent treatment is a great way to resolve conflicts. Anyway, that ends and we have this brief, fucked up \"open relationship\". She's still never around ever. Everytime we talk she seems distant and we fight a lot, and she always brings up how I acted like an asshole to her friends at the party. She also tells me in some weird vague way she thinks I'm abusive and jealous and possessive (I would deny the first, but I'll admit readily to the latter 2).\n\nI eventually break up with her because I'm sick of being constantly ignored. We still live together and fight a lot. We have a big blowup about her relationship with that guy because she sleeps on his couch every night and she tells me he was the friend she leaned on because she realised our relationship wasn't working. She also basically told me she realised she wanted to break up a while ago but couldn't bring herself to do it because she knew I loved her so she just kinda started being away until I finally did.\n\nI am picking a lot of fights lately and frankly being a lot more abrasive than I need to in them because I'm so angry and bitter and hurt about how it all went and I'm wondering if I'm the abusive asshole she says I am. As a fun note, she claims that after the party she had random friends of friends telling her \"your boyfriend is shitty, you should leave him\" because people don't mind their own goddamned business anymore. \n\nAnyway. This has probably gone on long enough and you're probably bored. be honest, roast me should you care to, I just want to know.\n\nTL;DR - Relationship was fucked. Girlfriend started ignoring me for 2 months and sleeping over at a guys house all the time. I was an asshole to her friends at her birthday, we broke up later. I'm resentful and have a bone to pick so I'm picking lots of fights", "score": 21, "comments": [], "label": null}]
