Faking an illness or money problems can be complicated but proving you've moved house when you haven't is easy. They only ever ask for 2 utility bills at most that are recent. Modifying your bills can be easy to do if you know how.\n\nIf you have a PDF editor start with that, or find a free one or get a cracked copy of acrobat for bonus law breaking. If the bill has a font you don't have you can usually find it free online. Acrobat will tell you what the font is even if it doesn't have it, just try to edit the text and a yellow warning hint will tell you the font.\n\nYou can then change the address on an existing bill to another one. For ease it's better to modify the date of a genuine bill when you lived elsewhere or the name of a friend's bill who does live somewhere else.\n\nFor added authenticity if you're bill has a QR code scan it and check the format then search QR code generator online and make your own.\n\nWhen you send in your forged documents to the provider be sure to print it out and fold it to fit an envelope. If you are emailing it take a picture of the document, a person who can't work a scanner definitely can't forge a bill, right?\n\nSteer clear from government documents, best to do water, electric and broadband bills. \n\nSpeaking from the UK, data protection law forbids companies from disclosing information about customers in most circumstances. For example, your electricity provider would not be allowed to confirm your address to your gym you are leaving so the gym will rely on the information you provide.\n\nJust to make things easier, most administrative staff will not put in that much scrutiny for your cancellation. They are far too busy/not interested enough to try and call you out on anything especially when they have no reason to suspect you of foul play.\n\nFinally, if you suck at computer stuff you can find any number of websites online that will provide forgeries for small fees (\u00a325).

Use cryptocurrencies this way.", "selftext": "Let's assume you've got a ton of cash that you don't want to report for whatever reason. In order to spend that cash on anything more than gas or groceries you're gonna need a way to launder it or give that cash a story. There are a ton of ways to do this but none that are untraceable...most money laundering schemes come with a ton of risk. But if I were properly motivated, this is how I'd do it. \n\nFirst I'd create a private trust. No need to understand how private trusts work in this thread, just know that they exist in a jurisdiction foreign to the US or whatever statutory jurisdiction you exist in. Then have that trust create a public LLC in a state that allows for private member owned LLC such as New Mexico. Literally all that is recorded is the name of the trust on the articles of organization for the LLC. So ABC Trust is the member of the LLC. The members of the trust are private and unknown. \n\nNow the LLC needs to be a legitimate cash business that wont draw any suspicion and impossible to audit. And ideally we want to convert all of our cash into cryptocurrencies. Unlike most money laundering schemes that hope to pay taxes and deposit cash into a bank. Cryptocurrencies are superior to cash in a bank for many reasons, but I'll only touch on a few here. \n\nSo the LLC creates an online peer to peer exchange. It's important that the LLC never actually touches the money because if it does then the exchange would be considered a money changing business and needs to comply with KYC and AML laws. We don't want that. So instead we set up an escrow wallet service that is nothing more than a smart self executing contract. Its computer code that executes when conditions are met. That's it. Peers come to the site to find other peers to trade with. These p2p exchanges already exist like localbitcoins.com for example. \n\nHere's how they work. I have cash or gift cards or some other form of money and I want to buy bitcoin. You've got bitcoin and want cash. So you send your BTC to an escrow wallet on the p2p exchange. This escrow wallet wont release the funds until all parties sign. The buyer and the seller and the exchange must all sign with their private keys to send the money out of the wallet. So once your BTC is locked in the wallet, we meet up and exchange cash, or I send you the gift cards or whatever payment method we agree. Once you get the cash, you sign to verify you recieved the cash. Once I send the money, I sign to verify payment was sent. If there are no disputes between the parties then the exchange signs and the BTC is sent to my personal wallet. Easy peasy. And since the exchange never actually has control of the BTC or the cash, they don't require any knowledge of the trading parties. Just 2 anonymous characters. Now in order to not attract a lot of unwanted attention, its important to set buy limits. Even those we aren't regulated as a money changing business we don't want to allow million dollar transactions without any kind of KYC... so we comply with the $1,000 limit per day. \n\nNow once the seller has cash they can spend it or deposit it into their bank or do whatever. Once I have BTC now I can do pretty much anything I want. First BTC is a transparent blockchain so I've got one more step to make this truly anonymous and untraceable. I'll send that BTC to an unverified crypto exchange account on Bitfinex or Binance or any number of other exchanges and I'll use that BTC to buy Monero. I wont explain how Monero (XMR) works here but trust me, it uses fancy cryptography to make it truly untraceable. There's no trail to follow. No XMR can be linked to any other party ever. So once I have XMR I can send it to any private wallet I want and no one will ever know I've got millions worth of XMR. It's as if the money disappears. If I ever want to spend it, I try to pay directly with XMR fir whatever. But if the vendor doesn't accept XMR then I simply send that XMR back to the exchange and trade it for BTC. Or I send it to my verified exchange account linked to my bank and I trade it directly for USD. I'll pay a capital gains tax on that single transaction vs paying gains on my millions. \n\nSo in order to do this at scale with our own p2p exchange LLC we need to create a dozen fake anonymous accounts all making small random trades to other legitimate sellers of BTC. Once we have gotten rid of all of our cash and now have BTC we funnel those BTC to dozens of unverified exchange accounts and wash them with XMR. Then send those XMR to our final destination wallet that no one knows about. When we want to spend it some amount, we simply funnel the XMR back into a verified and legitimate account and pay the tax on that individual transaction. Or we go back to our p2p exchange and get cash back. \n\nThat's it. That's how you hide millions of dollars without a trace. Of course I've left out a few details like how to spoof your IP address and use things like VPNs and Tor to truly access the exchange site anonymously, and you'll need to do this since you will be the one creating dozens of accounts on the exchange. Each account needs it's own IP address to appear legitimate to anyone who gets wise and wants to look closer. Other than that, you've now got millions of dollars in your pocket you can walk across any border anywhere in the world with.

Such is the life of anyone who frequents the dark net markets to buy or sell illegal goods and services. Some simple steps can be taken to mitigate risks, both legal liability and the risks of getting ripped off. \n\n[DISCLAIMER:] I'm not an attorney so take the following with a grain of salt...\n\nThere exists a hierarchy of law forms. What most of us operate under is known as Statutory law. It's pretty low on the scale of law forms and requires consent...but most of us give consent unknowlingly through various contractual relationships we enter into, or consent is presumed when no other law form is expressed. For this reason its important to Express a governing law form for any agreement you enter into with anonymous characters. Express in your contract that parties entering this agreement do so WITHOUT the US and its franchisees and waive all legal protections and benefits of the same and do so willingly agree to be governed by the terms set forth hereinafter in this agreement....(something to that effect should do it.) \n\nNow since you've waived your rights to use a Statutory court for dispute resolution, since all of your activity violates statutory law anyway, its important to Express a proper venue for arbitration. Determine who shall act as an escrow for the exchange of property/goods and who should arbitrate in case of a dispute. These escrow services already exist in the dark net markets but I'm not aware of any private arbitration. (Which just means the person who provides this service stands to make a lot of business). \n\nShould you ever find yourself in front of a statutory judge, all you SHOULD have to present is the contract expressing a different jurisdiction and venue. The judge should immediately realize he doesn't have authority to even hear the merits of the case and must dismiss on the spot. (This actually happens all the time. Haliburton was sued and it went all the way to the supreme court and they held that the lower courts were correct in that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on the matter because parties had a third party arbitration clause.) \n\nUsing escrow and private arbitration keeps all the parties honest. The vendor can't get paid until the consumer receives the product or service and should anyone get ripped off a neutral third party will act as a court and look only at the terms of that particular contract as LAW. If its expressed in the terms of the agreement then that's how the arbitration rules. No fancy legal loopholes. And it can all be done anonymously. \n\nIf you do illegal shit, then protect your interests.

Most have much more sinister intentions. Never the less, this is generally how its done. I know of 3 ways to do this but 2 are really simple and don't require a lot of technical knowledge. \n\nBuy an external network adapter that can go into monitor mode and inject packets. There are several options such as TP-Link N150 TL-WN722N or Alfa AWUSO36NH \n\nTwo different versions\n\n1) Set the wifi adapter to scan all open networks and devices sensing ans receiving packets. You should see all open wifi networks within range and the MAC addresses of any devices connected. \n\n2) Change your MAC address to one that is connected to a wifi network and you will gain access ti the wifi network without needing login credentials. This WILL kick the other users device off the network so this solution wont last forever. So once you gain access to the network you need to find the router settings and see if you can get the password. \n\nSecond version \n\n1) use the same network adapter you purchased previously and scan open wifi networks. \n\n2) set the adapter up as a hotspot and copy the same name as an open wifi network. This will trick users into logging into your fake hotspot vs the legitimate wifi network. \n\n3) once users try to connect they will enter their username and password.\n\n4) use their login credentials to gain access to their network. \n\nThis second method is much better but often times requires you create a landing page exactly like the landing page for the router...which you may not know. If the page doesn't look legitimate then it will raise suspicion to a savvy user. Plus once you're logged in to the network your MAC address will be visible so the admin may ban your address from the network. \n\nYou could also perform a man in the middle attack and capture the 3 way handshake when users connect then use password cracking tools like air aircrack to decrypt the the password. This is slightly more complicated and may take some time to crack but is much more stealthy.

Haha very funny. IRS catches on, and now the feds are after you. So, how to start?\n\nStep 1. Anonymity. Maintaining an anonymous trail is important. Specifically, you should never let your identity be linked to your bitcoin transactions. Download a bitcoin wallet.\n\nStep 2. buying bitcoins. Go to [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/). They match buyers and sellers. Take your wad of cash, your smartphone and wallet, and go buy your bitcoins. At this point, your money is somewhat safe! Its on a personally held wallet, on the most venerable blockchain, and you have a ready made market to sell them. However, you may be worried about the price of bitcoin going down.\n\nStep 3. Move to a more... stable crypto. The Dai stable coin and the USDTether are both coins that are stable in relation to the us dollar. They can be bought with bitcoin, and the following markets sell DAI stable coins: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dai/#markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dai/#markets). Binance, bittrex and bitfinex offer USDTether. DAI is safer than tether in the long run in my opinion. You can also choose to invest in potentially profitable projects and watch the value of your tokens go up. I personally made 50k off a 4k investment last year simply because I kept my money in bitcoin rather than dollars because fuck the system. That was a wild ride. There are lots of stable good projects that have winning potential, my top picks are iota, ethereum, and of course bitcoin.\n\nStep 4. Move your money off market. Keep it in a safe wallet. When tax assessors come looking, you have no money. your bank account is empty. There is no money under the couch. Then you can sell your bitcoins, and take a reduced tax on the proceeds of the sale. How reduced? Well your 20-30&#37; tax goes to 0 under 28k in the US. Your other withdrawals also go down. When you actually cash out, your have saved the tax bill, potentially made money, and can pat yourself on the back for not funding the likes of the US gestapo aka ICE, or the US version of the Waffen SS aka the US military.", "score": 19, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "8ue3wo", "name": "t3_8ue3wo", "created_utc": 1530139414.0, "title": "[ILPT Request]anyway to check if your fingerprints or dna is on a police database", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "8uesmf", "name": "t3_8uesmf", "created_utc": 1530145528.0, "title": "ILPT Request: How to get a restaurant manager fired?", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 292, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "8ug6x2", "name": "t3_8ug6x2", "created_utc": 1530158459.0, "title": "ILPT: need new tires but can't afford them?", "selftext": "Go to a rental place and rent the same type of car you have, and switch them out!\n\nOr at the very least same brand of vehicle with same amount of lugnuts.

Sorry if it's too dense. This is mostly about behavior and tactics, nothing technical. If I *had* ever shoplifted, and this weren\u2019t all completely hypothetical, I would never ever get caught, using these general rules:\n\n1. Don\u2019t shoplift from liquor stores, anywhere the owner is strapped, anywhere that has iron bars over the windows, pawn shops, or generally places where the cashier has an unobstructed view of the room. They\u2019re ready for you. It\u2019s just a bad idea. If you\u2019re that good, by all means, it\u2019s just much too risky for my tastes. Instead, hit big retailers like Freddy's, Safeway,  though non-franchised supermarkets aren't as likely to have stringent corporate loss prevention policies. The employees in big stores generally can\u2019t be bothered, and are too spread out to closely monitor the entire floor.\n2. **Stay. Calm.** Act like you\u2019re there as a regular shopper. If you put on a face that says \u201cI just got off work and am slightly annoyed but not threatening,\u201d people won\u2019t question you. Also, going around and browsing different aisles while pretending to compare things for a moment can help, but be careful of retreading ground more than twice.\n3. Be clean, I think being shaving helps as a man unless you have carefully groomed facial hair, and avoid unkempt hairstyles, or anything else that might be associated with \u201cunsavory folk\u201d. Dress and act like a **middle class white person**, even if you\u2019re not. Seriously, it throws people off the scent like nothing else\n4. Once you're ready, survey the entrances and exits. Oftentimes, even places with theft prevention gates will have an entrance/exit without them. Find an exit that is as far from the cashiers as possible, and use that. If there isn\u2019t one, most of the time if you just walk by the cashiers with your stuff, then walk towards the exit like nothing is wrong, no one will question you, as the first cashiers you walk by will assume you\u2019re going to the next one, and the last will assume you went to a previous one, if they\u2019re even paying attention at all. Often just walking through/near self checkout is enough. I generally wouldn\u2019t advise these tactics if the store is completely dead. Also, **NEVER EVER** book it unless you\u2019ve been caught, triggered theft prevention gates, or are RIGHT near the entrance, not that this will ever happen if you play it cool.\n5. Even if a store has theft prevention gates at every entrance, they don\u2019t always work. There are a lot of different types and ways to get around them/test their efficacy. A lot of times they don't even work or don't detect items without \"hard tags\", the things you might find on clothing. This article gives great insights on how to beat security gates, in addition to providing other helpful links. I would recommend exploring them if you want to steal more high value items without risk: [http://blog.envysion.com/retail/how-thieves-beat-security-tags-in-retail-stores](http://blog.envysion.com/retail/how-thieves-beat-security-tags-in-retail-stores). \n6. Case the area you want to lift from for cameras by quickly scanning the ceiling and walls when employees aren\u2019t looking (although, even if there are cameras, the quality is generally shit, you can just keep your head down or wearing a baseball cap if you so choose, and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re really in danger from some shitty security guy who probably doesn\u2019t even review tapes anyways).\n7. A bag can be helpful in places where there are camera blindspots, and at least one place in the store where often no one will be around for at around 10-20 seconds at a time. It\u2019s easier to find these spots than you might think. You really don\u2019t often need one though, and in supermarkets, it\u2019s usually MUCH safer to grab a basket and act like you belong. Bags are usually better for non anally observant smaller stores, which I\u2019ll go over in a sec.\n8. To minimize risk when leaving, a bike is better than a car, cause you can just quickly unlock it, leave the parking lot through a place where cars can\u2019t go, maybe a little hillside at the edge of the parking lot, then disappear into a nearby neighborhood. It\u2019s also faster and more endurant than some theft prevention fool trying to run you down. You should never even have to use this advice if you follow the rest of the guide. Once you\u2019ve hit a place successfully, this probably isn\u2019t very important.\n9. If you live in CA, HA, IL, IN, IA, LA, ME, MA, MI, MO, NE, NV, NM, OH, SD, WA, WV, or WY, then congrats! You can find a lot of stores where you can just walk in and grab liquor.\n\n**If you do want to lift from a smaller place, there are a few things to consider:**\n\n1. Even if they prohibit bags, it\u2019s not always a sign that they\u2019re well equipped to deal with you. Test the waters by walking in with a backpack as if you\u2019re just going about your day, acting like you\u2019re there with the intent to buy a specific thing, and stay calm. If they call you out, give them your bag, look around, and leave. That person\u2019s watching you. If you want, try again when a different cashier is there. Different people give different levels of shits.\n2. Find a route through the store with the least amount of eyes. Don\u2019t be overt about it, just notice it on your way in. The same logic applies with entrances/exits as large stores, but your pathing inside the store is more important here.\n3. Once you\u2019re in, check for cameras as you would at a large store, but be MUCH more careful, and don\u2019t lift while in their FOV. They are probably actually watching them. If you find a spot where there aren\u2019t cameras though, just casually grab whatever it is you want, walk to the blind spot, and put it in your bag.\n4. When leaving after using a bag/pockets/coat, it can help ease suspicion to lightly furrow your brow, and shake your head slightly as if to say: \"Nope, didn't find what I was looking for. I'm slightly annoyed, and just want to get on with my day.\"\n5. Convenience stores are low return, and vary drastically in risk. I wouldn\u2019t even bother, as the proprietors are often watchful/shrewd, and it\u2019s kinda more dickish to steal from a small business than a large one that can absorb tons of losses.\n\nHonestly, now that I've written this, it's kind of just like a trivially easy stealth game. I hope this helps you think about how to shoplift, purely intellectually of course. If I\u2019ve offered any bad advice, or you have things to add, please let me know!

After learning of this I took my Zippo lighter with me in my pocket, through airport security even when going through the scanner it didn't go off; after learning I thought of this ILPT, instructions below.\n\nFirst get or buy a Zippo lighter, (for more space make sure to get a normal Zippo and not a Zippo Slim). Next, take the metal lighter insert out of the brass bottom case, next unscrew the screw, take out the felt pad and then take out all of the rayon balls, cut the wick to make sure it is short and not taking up space and then tape it to the inside of the insert so that the wick does not move around. After doing this you can put whatever you desire within the inside of the metal insert, e.g. a small dime bag of drugs, a small flash drive, whatever you want (I recommend putting whatever item you are concealing, inside a waterproof package e.g. small plastic bag, saran wrap, whatever). After this completely clean everything that may have traces of drugs or whatever on it, on the lighter. However, after finishing up make sure to surround the item with rayon balls so that it does not move around within the insert, also make sure to put some rayon balls covering the item so that one will not be able to see it if they lift the felt pad. next pour some lighter fluid onto the rayon balls, to make sure it smells right. After finishing with this, put the felt pad back in and screw in the screw. The final step is just putting it into metal insert into the lighter body. And there you go.\n\nTips:\nIf the item that you are concealing is pungent then make sure it is in a sealed bag and then douce that bag in lighter fluid, so that if one were to smell the lighter it will just smell like a lighter fluid.\n\nIf there is a sniffing dog at the airport security, I am not too sure if they would be able to smell the drugs even if they were doused in lighter fluid, but I wouldn't take my chances.", "score": 81, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "93rurj", "name": "t3_93rurj", "created_utc": 1533149811.0, "title": "ILPT Request: how to get instagramm followers?", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "93rydp", "name": "t3_93rydp", "created_utc": 1533150477.0, "title": "ILPT Request: How to get free and simple steam gift cards", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "93t5ba", "name": "t3_93t5ba", "created_utc": 1533158432.0, "title": "ILPT: Burger king actually does do breakfast all day, if you bring a gun", "selftext": "", "score": 1870, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "93trdb", "name": "t3_93trdb", "created_utc": 1533162857.0, "title": "Want to get out of a Speeding Ticket?

This is especially so with illicit activities, and just like any other goal the key to success is planning. Now when considering wether or not to task myself to any illegal activity i heavily consider the risk to reward ratio. And if my motives are so compelling or possibly out of necessity, I then incorporate steps into my plan of action to reduce the risk factors to a number im comfortable with. Once satisfied its best to devise the primary course of action first(plan a) while the factors from the initial calculations are still fresh. Then on to plan b, naturally plan is a backup plan, however it certainly isnt a contingency(those are needed in every step of a good plan). Plan-B should start and end at the same stages as plan-A, and also needs to conform around most static level implications. Plan-B should be sporting a similar risk to reward ratio as plan-A, and must also be easily transitioned into. These structural itinerary elements are all major requirements to achieve the UnBustability status. The key to reaching such a godlike state is in fact Plan-C, when put into action properly Plan-C can resolve almost any hang-up(excluding things like a rat or combat with law enforcement). When in my youth my comrades and i discovered the seemingly limitless uses of Plan-C there immediately spawned a running joke/word game that simply consisted of naming problems Plan-C couldn't fix.

Let the flask stay for 20-25 minutes.\n\nIn this time the solution will boil, so u need to have some kind of condenser on top, if u cant get a real condenser (which u should), then ill post a pic of a ghetto implementation.\n\nWhen the reaction is over put on hotplate and reflux for about an hour. You really should get a condenser for this, they are cheap and will last forever. You can skip the reflux but the yield wont be as good.\n\nAfter 45 minutes the stuff will start to look a little pink.\n\nWhen reflux is over let cool to room temperature and youll have a red/yellow solution.\n\nWhile the solution is cooling, in a seperate glass container mix 50g of sodium hydroxide and 50ml of water and stir to make sure it mixes well. Put in freezer until its not hot anymore.\n\nWhen both solutions are cool, slowly add the sodium hydroxide solution to the reaction mix. You DONT want to do it too fast because it will react violently and might jump out of the flask. So add slowly and stir after each addition.\n\nWhen done adding there will be 2 layers. Use a pipette and suck up the top layer. Put this in seperate glass. Now add 20ml of Dichloromethane to the mix and shake/stir really well, then let settle, this time we want the bottom layer, use a pipette to suck up the bottom DCM layer and add this to the first layer we pulled. Add another 20ml of DCM and repeat one more time, combine all the DCM pulls and the first layer we pipetted. Combine the 3 pulls together.\n\nNow this has our Amphetamine freebase. Now we need to convert the Amphetamine freebase into Amphetamine Sulphate. We make a solution of 1ml Sulfuric Acid/5ml Isopropanol. Drop by drop add the sulfuric acid solution to the DCM/amphetamine solution and stir alot. You will begin to see the Amphetamine Sulphate crystallize out of solution.\n\nWhen done adding the solution, setup a coffee filter inside a funnel. Pour the Amphetamine solution into the filter. Then let dry.\n\nNow youll have a slightly red/dirty Amphetamine Sulphate. Do a recrystallization to get pure white Amphetamine Sulphate.", "score": 58, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9frpmz", "name": "t3_9frpmz", "created_utc": 1536929342.0, "title": "ILPT: How to make LSD via Morning Glory Seeds", "selftext": "MAKING LSD\n\nCommon LSD, being of the strangest drugs, available to people on the black market, is not too hard to make in your average run-of-the-mill kitchen.

Start adding\n\nthe styrofoam to the gasoline, stirring until it dissolves into a\n\nliquid approximately the consistancy of honey or syrup. Caution, do not\n\nover dissolve styro as it has a tendency to expand and become\n\ntoo thick. (A little experimentation here works out well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPour the mixture into the dry bottles, (water in them will be dangerous\n\nto user) leave enough room at the top to plug the hole tightly with\n\na strip of rag folded in half. Do not saturate rag at this time with\n\ngas or napalm. The rag should extend into the void at the top of the\n\nbottle about 2\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeployment:\n\nTransport to site of usage carefully, and upright. DONT SMOKE! Turn\n\nbottle upside down briefly to saturate wick, or wick can be doused with\n\nlighter fluid or charcoal lighter. (I don't use pure gasoline here\n\ncause of premature ignition of device). Light wick, and deploy\n\nimmediately, smashing against the object to be napalmed.

And dont be a donut and order stuff to any adress youre anyway potentially known to be affiliated with (as always my desperado friends, always avoid properties on main roads and cul de sacs).\n\nNow at this point you might be thinking this type of manovure is doomed to failure (and im not by any means saying  this is a dead cert, youre probably going to have to make a judgement call based on the interplay of a variety mitigating factors).  Please let me try and explain why you *might* (at least sometimes) be wrong.\n\nRecently i heard on the radio that statistically, 89% of men under the age of 25 have malware from places like Pornhub on their phone, have evidence of porn searches permenantly on their phone as well as having dirty vids (both professional and even better, vids of themselves fucking or even even better *wanking*).  Out there doing field work, i havnt exxactly been concerning myself with compiling staistical data but id say this number is about right.  And intrestingly, ive found way more girls have evidence of NSFW stuff on their phones than i would have thought.  Im not quite sure what the official stats are for females having porn on their devices but maybe in my expierience its around 60% (maybe less of an emphasis on vids, but way more kik typ stuff.  Oh and *way* more girls are into gay porn than you may have thought.  Even really hot girls).  \n\nAnyway, given the tendency for young people having porn on their phones, upon waking up from a crack round the canister, a student twat might be reluctant to call the police because they know that if a cuntstable made an inquiry into their internet/phone activities, their NSFW stuff might become apparant.\n\nWhen faced with this dilema, the one most important determining factor in them deciding not to contact the filth would be their surprise and relief at finding they still have their walllet /purse.  Suddenly, they might think theres an upper limit on the loss theyre going to experience and theve already reached it, namely the loss of their phone which daddy will probably replace for them tommorow anyway.  THIS IS WHY ITS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO TOUCH ANY CASH YOU FIND.  Students are kinda like snobs and they believe anyone who is forced to live outside the confines of the law are incapable of exercising restraint.  If they see their cash is still where it really shouldnt be, theyll believe that you just missed it.  However, if the cash is gone, they might start to wonder and immediatly contact the bank to cancell their card.\n\nStudents sometimes have some stupid limit on the withdrawls they can pull in a single day so this is why this method might (sometimes) be worthwhile.

I had known him through highschool and a little before that, and we had played sports together and some other activities together as well, between 2006-2011. We didn't speak much outside of that but he was decent, as far as I knew him. About 5 months ago, he sends me a message with some sob story (second red flag) about how he needs $700 for rental unit issues. Not his residence, but a rental garage. Something about a mixup in billing with someone else and him. Anyway, after the story, and thinking I knew the guy, I lent him the $700, with an agreement that he'd pay me back in a week. He needed money, was younger than me, had a wife and kid, and although $700 was a lot to me..it seems like he needed it more than me, and I could breathe without that amount, so I figured i'd do him a favour.\n\nWell, a week comes and goes, and he says he had car damage and needed a bit more time (third red flag). I said sure, pay me back next paycheck. He never bothers to follow up. I message him again, and he said he'll get it to me in 2 days. I told him to at least pay me half now, and the rest after. At this point, I figured anything was better than nothing. You can probably guess that he never paid even that much, nor did he bother ever following up. Since then, he hasn't responded to me in 4 months. I saw him once in public from a distance, and he ducked and avoided me and ran. \n\nWhat can I do to at least screw with him, if he won't pay me back?

Sorry about spelling and grammar and this is gonna be long, I go very in depth when I'm drunk.\n\nThe reason that strategy is Bullshit is because of the multiple variables that are completely uncontrollable plus I don't like trusting a strangers taste in lunch. \n\nMy strategy plays into the distrust of corporate and store managers. If you have a legitimate compliant about your food/service then you call the corporate customer service number and give them the receipt number and explain what was wrong/bad about your experience and then they contact the store with your info to be added to a \"list\"(it's literally called \"the list\")\n\nNow, everyone of these \"corporate\" complaints is counted against the store in a corporate review of the store.

So I go through the drive through (if your not good with social engineering drive through is the best. It also works walking into the store but you have to be good at social engineering to keep a calm demeanor. Drive through is quicker because you tell the order taker the \"problem\" and they ask what the order was and to pull up to the next window. When you pull up the manager will be at the window and you give the \"cliff notes\" version of the problem. The order taker has already told them everything you've said). The conversation goes like this:\n\nThem: Hi, welcome to X what I can I get for you?\n\nMe: Hi. Ummmmmmmmm. I was here (1-2 weeks is a good time frame to say when they fucked up your order) and I was told that that I could come back and get the correct order.\n\nThem: Who did you talk to?( this is the time you decide if you want to play the corporate distrust and say \" the 1-800 number on the receipt acting like your clueless\" or you can say \"I don't remember, I called the store and talked to someone and they said id be added to a list.\" You can add \"the list\" part in either senriao. After all of that they will double check your and give it to you for free. \n\nAn easy excuse on how they fucked up your order is either, they have you somebody else's order or your burger was plain or had toppings you didn't want.\n\nI'm tried of typing so I'll probably make a separate post on the to go order shit. It's bassicly the same strategy but heavely relies on social engineering.\n\nEdit: it seems everyone is focusing on McDonald's becuase I used the other McDonald's post as a reference on why I made this post. Yes. McDonald's is the EASIEST to scam food from.

He was a constant liar and would make a 6 hour shift just absolutely miserable.\n\nHe was fired at the end of August. Less than 2 weeks later, he filed a claim through the Peace Court and said that he was fired unjustly. He wanted something like $5k in damages. The owner showed up in court and he lost. He appealed and this time, he name dropped ME and said it was my fault that he got fired. I was patient with him but this is the last straw. I stayed loyal and did his grunt work for almost 4 years and he pulls this shit on me.\n\nMy request is what can I do to make his daily life a little more annoying?

I'm sure you've all seen the videos of people stealing packages off of stoops. Whenever someone would call in and claim that their package was stolen, we would immediately issue a refund. It didn't matter if it was a TV or a T-shirt. The only exception was when the package required a signature. Poopon, however, was very cheap and always shipped via the cheapest option, so almost nothing <$5,000 or super big required a signature. They even shipped a $10K ring without requiring a signature and issued a full refund when the customer said they never got it. Poopon did push back and make them jump through some hoops, but at the end of the day the customer got the 10K. We did put on a note on the account and would only issue 1 per account, generally, but that first one was a gimme. AFAIK the policy has not changed. Worse comes to worst just make sure it's returnable when buying and print off the return label and send it back if they won't refund, but I'm 99% if you keep pushing and make a stink they'll just refund. Most of their CS goes to India/Philippines now, and those people really couldn't care less.\n\nActually feel free to defraud them with impunity if you want. I saw hacking rings where people got into hundreds of accounts and racked up 10s of thousands in fake orders that we had to refund. We had addresses where things were being shipped and a lot of other IP, etc identifying info. Poopon never did anything but refund and block. They never once involved the authorities. There's a real cost of doing business mentality combined with a \"no bad press\" fear that kept those hackers in business.\nEnjoy!", "score": 22, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9qxxl1", "name": "t3_9qxxl1", "created_utc": 1540371627.0, "title": "ILPT: Before going on vacation, trash your place.

Big Ass subwoofers.\n* Startup funds, depending on what drug you want to sell (weed is the cheapest, huffing kittens the most expensive)\n\n**Bought Yourself a Gun**  \nYou  may be fuckin squeamish about killing, or even shooting at someone.   That is normal. That is what the crack whore is for. For a hit, you can   practice threatening him or her, smack him or her around a bit, or even   pistol whip him or her. This invaluable training will ensure you do  not  hesitate on the street. Drug users, especially cocaine users, have   developed an extraordinary sense of smell which allows them to smell   police, fear, and other drug salespeople. Until you have this sense, you   must assume that you reek of cowardice and noobishness. Try flaring   your nostrils and keeping your shit. Cokeheads do this, and that's what   gives them their edge.\n\nThe gun is also  handy, however, because  it will instantly make you feel braver, and  stronger. And thanks to the  resurgence of drug use, the materials  needed to get going are more  available than they had been. This is  really the perfect time to get  into a career in sales.\n\n**Find a Supplier**\n\nThis  is simple: buy in bulk. You'll pay a  small markup, but that will come  down as the salesperson begins to  trust you. Then, once he or she is  fully comfortable with you, order a  small deliver, and whack him or  her. Pick up the dead salesperson's cell  phone and call the number on  the phone that doesn't have a name, but  was 'received' most recently.  That's your supplier. And trust me, money  is money. The supplier won't  care that you whacked his footman, because  you'll be the new grunt.\n\n**Drug House**  \nDon't  be confused: Trap Houses and Drug Houses are the same thing. Two   schools of thought on this one: either move to the worst neighborhood   that you can possibly find, because your competition will be too scared   to come after you, or move to a really nice neighborhood, where the   police are all being paid off already by some rich mogul, so you know   they're corrupt. Its up to you, but if you plan on cooking meth, I'd go   with the cheaper house. Meth labs explode all the time, and nothing is   more embarrassing than blowing up your kitchen during the annual block   party.\n\n**Black SUV with Big Rims**  \nPeople often say its best to be inconspicuous, but this just isn't true.   Police are smarter than ever now, and its likely that they will pass   over the nice cars, because they assume that no salesperson is dumb   enough to have such a flashy ride. Now days, they'll just assume you're a   rap star or athlete they haven't heard if you're a guy, and a really   good escort if you're a woman. Neither is on their short list of people   to harass, believe me.\n\nThe SUV will also  give you ample space in  which to store your drugs and drug  accessories, and for some reason, no  one gives citations for SUVs with  tinted windows. Also, and this is  vital, the windows are so high off  the ground, people can't look in and  see the drugs on your backseat.  For people who are 'down', the nice ride  will tell them, \"Hey, this  person is a successful drug salesperson.\"  This is like free advertising  for you! Finally, big SUVs look cool, and  they seem to proclaim,  \"Screw rising oil prices, I'm \\*\\*\\*\\*ing rich,  \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*!\" ...........\n\n**Jacket With a Lot of Pockets and Startup Funds**  \nSelf  Explanatory.

And make a new email account while you have the VPN on.\n\nWhen you have that set up, do a google for \"hackforums RAT\".\n\nRat stands for Remote Administration Tool.\n\nThese programs are used by companies to monitor their employees, but you can use it to monitor your targets, break into their computer, and steal information.\n\nWhen you find the site, make an account and look for the marketplace in which they sell the RATS. \n\nIf you are a poorfag, get a free tool from the site. But dont be surprised if it works like shit. Paid RATs are much better. (I recommend using Orca because there are plenty of guides YT that helps you set it up) \n\nPsa NEVER DOWNLOAD HACKTOOLS FROM YOUTUBE, you get ratted instead!\n\nNo matter how legit it looks, its a trick to fuck you over.\n\nAfter you got your RAT you can set it up.\n\nNow is the moment you will realize shit is getting detected by your antivirus. \n\nThats fucked, but we can fool the antivirus.\n\nGet a Crypter from the same site. These tools encrypt your hacking program you made earlier. Meaning that antivirus wont detect your program anymore. As extra benefit, you can hide your program inside video or photo files this way :)\n\nWhen done encrypting, use a spare computer to test your RAT on. If it doesnt work, go back to the pc you used to build it on and try again, switch around some settings etc. Make sure to test it by using different wifi connections for each pc so you know it works even when its not on your local wifi.\n\nAt some point you will get it to work, and at that point you have a great hack tool.\n\nNow you may wonder, how to even spread such a program.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Download some youtube videos about cracked games, and reupload them with a link to the download, which is your RAT.\n\nGo in chatrooms, post a few photos from random hot girls, and link your RAT as a \"secret video\". Just act stupid and act like \"whoops didnt mean to upload a video\". Watch the clicks come in.\n\n\nWhen you ratted a few people, you can open hidden browser windows, and run the Coinhive miner to mine yourself monero on their pcs. More pcs, more money.\n\nIf you have any questions, drop them below.\n\nI wont be online all the time, but once in awhile I check in here.

All you have to do is rent a few discs, pop them in, and rip them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the methods for ripping books and discs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor books I'm not sure, if it's a paperback copy you could use something like CamScanner (mobile) to scan pages of the book, but it does take a while (you have to scan every page). I haven't done this but it's worth a shot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor CDs, if you need to rip them, use [Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/). It will create a 1:1 copy of the audio tracks on the disc, or allow you to compress to FLAC. For CD-ROM discs, you can use [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to create an [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image) (complete backup) of the disc. ImgBurn will not strip DRM/encryption from the discs, however. Though CD-ROMs/CD-DA never really had any DRM/encryption standards, some companies used other methods of copy-protection (i.e data you can't copy from the original CD, but the program will check for). YMMV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor DVDs, you can also make an ISO of the disc with [DVD Decrypter](http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/). You can also use [MakeMKV](http://makemkv.com/) to get 1:1 .MKV copies of the MPEG-2 streams on the disc instead of an ISO file. Again ImgBurn should work for unencrypted DVD-ROMs, but other forms of copy-protection may get into the way. For Wii games [Wii Backup Manager](http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk) should work, and will allow you to create ISO and WBFS files (even put them onto a WBFS-formatted HDD). For Xbox and PS2/PS3, I have no damn clue. Fill me in here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Blu-ray you can also use MakeMKV to create 1:1 backups of the AVC video streams on the disc. I suggest using Blu-ray when possible as it's a [1080p format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Video) with [lossless audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Audio) and [DVDs are 480i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data) with [lossy audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Audio_data) (bad quality). IIRC [DVDFab](https://www.dvdfab.cn/) allows you to make ISO backups of Blu-ray discs. You just have to crack DVDFab as it isn't free (you can download cracks).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can also request discs from other libraries to come in. The discs the libraries use are complete retail discs, meaning that it isn't the shitty rental ones you got from Blockbuster or Netflix back in 1999. This also carries no risk (unless you want to distribute the pirated content, which does help us) as nobody (your ISP, copyright trolls, the MPAA, or even the library) know what your doing unless you tell them. It's also good if you have shitty Internet or data caps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome libraries also have electronic borrowing methods, were you can download a book/movie from their WLAN and use a DRM crack to keep it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt gets even better. Some libraries have free Internet, so you can use their Internet for pirating, if you have shit Internet. Just make sure to use a VPN, as torrenting may get you in trouble. If yours doesn't have Internet, this needs to be raised as a public issue - help the library get funding for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYep. The library is amazing for piracy. I have ripped 6+  discs so far and have some stuff on hold.

I was inspired to share this from a very recent post:\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/IllegalLifeProTips/comments/9tn8il/ilpt_get_expensive_things_for_free_from_walmart/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nHope you checked that one out. So a short story first.\n\nA buddy of mine used to do this all the time. When executed confidently, it works flawlessly.  He did end up getting caught being cocky while visiting a Walmart in Missouri though.. try at your own risk.\n\n\nSo basically this is a two or three person scam.\nIt requires planning ahead and cordination.  \nYou want to keep the items you are looking to grab generally large enough to not require bagging. \n\nPerson 1 enters store at garden center (if possible) and gathers maybe half a dozen items. \nPerson 2 starts at other end of the store and grabs the SAME ITEMS in a less ordered and more casual fashion.\nPerson 1 pays for items in sporting goods in order to 'avoid the lines' and exits store through garden center (preferably). Feel free to offer reciept as proof of purchase - increases confidence.\nPerson 1 passes reciept to Person 3 waiting outside\nPerson 3 brings reciept to Person 2 and both proceed to self checkout. Person 3 buys some candy or something with Person 2 and both walk out.\n\nIf a reciept is requested, providing it is not a problem, be polite and oblige. Having fewer and open items shows confidence.\n\n\nFinally, take the second set of goods to a different Walmart and return them. Walmart will take returns from any other Walmart, guaranteed.\n\n\n\n\nTips: \n\nAlways enter with a plan\nAlways go during busy times\nAlways return items at different store location\nAvoid contact with other scammer.\nDo not follow same path in store\nRemain polite and cooperative\nDo not use same enterences or exits as other guy\n\n\nIdeal items:\n\nLaundry baskets\nMotor oil\n24 packs soda\nLarge children's toys\nStorage tubs\nRugs\nBoxers\nCat Food\nShoes\nCharcoal\nTents\nAir mattresses\n\n.......Common stuff......\n\n\n\nDamn.. sharing this with the Web is crazy. Have not really told anyone this stuff before. Just be smart and stick to the rules. As long as you don't get cocky it is not that difficult. And obviously it can be done with two people or one. But the risk is yours to own.\n\nThe knowledge is yours now. Be responsible with it and don't try it! \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Fill two carts with items that don't need to be bagged.

Train him to bite the neck if caught and modify his mouth replace his teeth with knives\n\n#EDIT:\n\nOkay since you are all so ignorant on this method Ill reveal how I did it once.\n\nFirst off, modifying your dogs mouth is easy but he must know to respect you. Assert dominance to your dog. Get a spoon and make it flaming hot, so hot that its red (dogs cant tell red color) and whenever the dog disobeys shove the spoon in his mouth (try between tongue and bottom jaw)\n\nNow you have a dog that wont ever disobey when spoons are around. Make a ground circle of spoons and place dog inside. Dog will try to move to all directions which will make his total movement zero. Proceed with the knife replacement surgery. Dont bother wasting drugs on dog, they dont have souls.\n\nNow starve the dog. No food till he is very weak. Then all of a sudden put a spider wrap filled with food and peanut butter on the wires next to his mouth. He has to work for his food make sure his knives are strong enough to open the security tag. Remember if he doesn\u2019t obey, spoon between tongue and bottom jaw. Start placing food filled spider wraps around boxes you own. Always starve the dog before this as he associates spider wraps with only source of food now. If you cant wait feed him laxatives (in spider wraps with food) so he remains hungry.\n\nNow you need an arduino board some motors and explosives. If the dog stays still for 6 seconds make the explosives trigger. You will need a camera sending you live video with a seperate board. The dog will stream it through youtube and you watch through tor. Control the first board with a tcp server. Connect there using tor. The dog will have a smartphone straped to him with data (steal a phone first and some data money) also a spoon on a thread that appears when the dog goes the wrong way while escaping lastly a robotic voice coming out saying \u201cSTAY AWAY OR I WILL EXPLODE\u201d\n\nFor the grand finale pay a homeless guy hold a spoon and your dog and throw a brick through  an electronics store and release your dog  (holding the spoon in a way to ensure he enters the store) the dog will find spider wrapped items to steal and run out (use spoon on a string to make him run out, you control where the spoon goes) keep using the spoon to escape and bring you the goods. If chased by helicopter make the spoon rotate fast around the dog so the dog stays still for 6 seconds and explodes.\n\nAnd now you have a free razer mouse. Fuck. I wanted logitech.

This guide is for educational purposes. RIP 808purp. \n\nMaking Methamphetamine at home:\n\nList of chemicals and materials: \nDiluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section\n\nNaOH - also called lye\n\nEthyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says \"high ethyl ether content\", such as Prestone\n\nEphedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.\n\nDistilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.\n\n\nList of equipment : \nA glass eyedropper \n\nThree small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).\n\nA Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) \n\nA glass quart jar \n\nSharp scissors\n\nClean rubber gloves\n\nCoffee filters\n\nA measuring cup\n\nMeasuring spoons \n\n\nPreparing your Lab:\n\nPreparing Ethyl Ether:\nWARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.\n\nTake the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.\n\nEthyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. \n\nEphedrine & or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum \n\n5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.\n\n6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). \n\n7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. \n\n8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.\n\n9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! \n\n10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. \n\n11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.\n\nIf you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts \"popping\", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.\n\nFirst Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)\n\nNow, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.\n\nItems needed:\nAlot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)\n\nCoffee filters (or filter paper)\n\nSomething that measures ml and grams\n\nA flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)\n\niodine\n\nHydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)\n\nRed Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)\n\nLye\n\n*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) \n\n\nMaking Red Phosphorus:\nThe striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?\n\nMaking Hydroiodic Acid:\nThis is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. \n\nNow, Making Methamphetamine:\nTo do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.", "score": 1124, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9u2qfa", "name": "t3_9u2qfa", "created_utc": 1541331846.0, "title": "ILPT: Start a dog DNA business.

My complaint was met with \"you have no proof, and he denies it happened. I told them that he needed to go, and how many complaints was it going to take. HR said \"get me proof\". Well, OK then. I started recording our conversations with my phone. All of them. Everytime we went anywhere, or he walked in my office, the phone started recording. Well, soon enough, he started spouting. In a crowded restaurant again, this time with another co-worker present. You can listen to that recording [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dM15R04gpJVDd4aEhocXV6SWs) is you are interested, but be warned, contains NSFW language. After this incident, I complained again to HR, and to my immediate supervisor, this time attaching the audio file. The end result? He was given a week off WITH PAY, and I was given a \"Level II reprimand\" whatever the fuck that means, for \"not following HR procedure\". On the way out of that reprimand meeting I arranged an interview with another company and left shortly after. \n\nHere comes the request part. This spooge-nugget has relocated to another city on the east coast. I want his new neighbours (it's a VERY small town) to know what kind of a twat-waffle this guy is. How can I go about distributing this audio file to his neighbours? Any thoughts? \n\nTIA.", "score": 32, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9upk0x", "name": "t3_9upk0x", "created_utc": 1541520156.0, "title": "This", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9upxtf", "name": "t3_9upxtf", "created_utc": 1541522676.0, "title": "ILPT: Do illegal things that benefit your business.

Having a bit of problem with blackmail part at the moment, I'll keep you updated. \n\nThis ain't easy as it seemed. \n\nChat avenue is saturated with e whoring 13 years old so they got wiser, you should go to some less known place such as 321 sex chat (specifically the \"older guy looking for younger section\") and bait them there.\n\nI played the role of a 15 years old swede who just arrived in california and feels pretty lonely, still a virgin, but horny, not used to the hot weather and American consumer culture. \nMost of the people there are from uk or usa so you can choose. As soon as you write something in chat (\"ehy people xd\" is enough) you'll get flooded by messages.\nPut a nice picture profile too in there (steal them from some far away country instagram, far away from you and from whoever you are trying to bait) and chat with them since this is not a ewhoring gig you have to take your time and don't look to horny. I'd advise to create a fake story with fake name before hand.\n\nThe only \"problem\" is that you won't be able to keep track of how many idiots you were able to convince. I personally attracted 40 horny dudes and ended up being able to convince only 3 of them to share personal information not because of mistakes in my game but because the interface sucks real hard.  \n\nWhen it comes to the blackmail part you won't ask for facebook but Gmail. When you are there keep talking to them until they reveal enough personal information to trace them via facebook or whitepages or sex offender registry like in the case of my boy. Once you have everything just keep ready with paypal.me account.\n\nBeside this you need expertise in blackmail, which i currently don't have. I'll keep exercising and I'll let you know.\n\nWorst case scenario just tell me where to drop the adress of this specific pedo so that 2 hours of talking like a 15 years swede at her first sexual experience were worth something and won't make feel dirty.", "score": 20, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9v0yyt", "name": "t3_9v0yyt", "created_utc": 1541608761.0, "title": "If I\u2019m wanting to score cocaine or LSD, how can I find a dealer?

If you do, I\u2019ll edit the post and add yours, along with your username for credit! \n\n\nFree money:\n\nREDBOX money scam: rent as many video games as possible. Report your credit card stolen or lost and ask for a new one. Your old card will now be canceled and redbox will now be unable to charge you it\u2019s fees. Take games to gamestop, preferably when they have the special going on saying you get the same amount in cash as you would store credit.

For one it will now be safe from cars and whatnot, and would be better off under your protection. Then contact the owners and cross your fingers for a reward or some kind of compensation for your good deeds! \n\nPUBLIX flu shot: Publix will pay you $10 to get a flu shot, visit all Publix\u2019s in your area and get free money from multiple shots. \n\nAMAZON and discover card scam: With the 5% cash back discover card, purchase items on amazon and then return them for amazon credit, discover won\u2019t find out about it and you\u2019ll make 5% whatever you spend!\n\nAMAZON return scam: Find really cheap items on amazon, and return them to Walmart or wherever for profit via gift card. If the % of profit is high enough, then sell those cards to websites that sell em for a certain % cheaper than face value. \n\nUNIVERSITY book donation bin: Most university\u2019s have a donated books bin where students donate their books for other students in need. Some books in the bin can be sold back to the schools bookstore, for usually around $80. If not, sell em on eBay! \n\n\n\nFree food/drinks: \n\nPOPCORN at movie theatre: Go to your movie, wait a little bit into the previews. Then search the trash cans for a bucket of popcorn, or the largest popcorn that theatre sells. (It\u2019s almost always free refills for a large). Pull it out, put it on the ground and step on it. Go to the concession stand and say \u201cHey, can i get a new bucket, some asshole stepped on my popcorn\u201d.

Some smaller churches also have free food after each service. \n\n\n\nSTARBUCKS FREE coffee, improved[from u/Kakuzi457]: Starbucks employee here. The simplest way to scam the system for a coffee, is to walk into starbucks, preferably when it\u2019s super busy, and stand at the end of the bar where the drinks are being handed off. A lot of the time, we will have to call out somebody\u2019s drink more than once because they didn\u2019t hear their name called, their in the bathroom, etc...

These are provided by default on every Xfinity modem. Every xfinitywifi hotspot is a poor Comcast customer who uses their default modem with default settings. The consumers pay for the electricity/hosting, while Comcast gets to charge people for using it. It's pure greed. Same with Spectrum, Cox, and other ISPs. Luckily, there's a way to profit off this, and get FREE Internet, for life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComcast provides 2 1-hour sessions of Internet for free, per month. This is tied to your device's MAC address. It's also a global database, so if you use session 1 at Ohio and use a hotspot in Indiana, you'll only have 1 session left, but if you use a different device, such as if you used a phone in OH, you can use your laptop in IN and have 2 sessions. This is because the laptop has a different MAC than the phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, how do you exploit this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally easy: for Windows, you will need to download [T-MAC](https://technitium.com/tmac/), a free software that will allow you to spoof your MAC. Use [this map](https://hotspots.wifi.xfinity.com/mobile/), provided by Comcast, to show where the hotspots are. Just use your free 2 hour sessions (With a disposal email), then open T-MAC, select your Wi-Fi adapter, and select \"Random MAC Address\". Your MAC will be changed and the hotspot will think you are someone else and give you 2 free sessions. Repeat. Profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor MacOS, I haven't tried it but this should work: [https://blog.macsales.com/43777-tech-101-spoofing-a-mac-address-in-macos-high-sierra](https://blog.macsales.com/43777-tech-101-spoofing-a-mac-address-in-macos-high-sierra)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Android, you'll need to root the device (really sucks) and for iOS, I think you can't (I've heard changing the MAC will brick the device, sucks even more). I've only tried this with Windows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, free Internet! I abused the HELL out of this back in 2016 when I had no WiFi. This should also work for ANY hotspot/Wi-Fi service that offers free sessions, but since I'm in a Comcast-only area I haven't tried it with Spectrum or Cox. I'm also sure you can setup a script to automatically reset the MAC after 2 hours. Since xfinitywifi is an open Wi-Fi network, you should get a VPN to encrypt your traffic if you're entering important information or doing illegal shit (prefect for piracy).", "score": 118, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9vc664", "name": "t3_9vc664", "created_utc": 1541699272.0, "title": "ILPT: COMPUTER SERVICES", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9vcchc", "name": "t3_9vcchc", "created_utc": 1541700437.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST: charge money to someone's phone bill with their number", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9vcha0", "name": "t3_9vcha0", "created_utc": 1541701323.0, "title": "Actual Way to Get Free Nintendo E Shop Cards?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9vcmz6", "name": "t3_9vcmz6", "created_utc": 1541702393.0, "title": "ILPT: want free money and a new car for a few hours?

They pay you in eBay vouchers instantly and you send them the iPhone. They require a card credit or debit to charge for the amount of the voucher if in case you don\u2019t send them the phone. They\u2019ll preauth literally a dollar\nOpen an account and \u201csell\u201d your iPhone, I just sold them an iPhone X i didn\u2019t have last week. They gave me an instant voucher for 600 something which I used to buy merchandise on the site including an Apple Watch series 4 and a new set of Airpods cause I keep losing my right one(off topic it\u2019s always the right Airpod like wtf 3 times now). I always pay the extra for faster shipping if the seller offers it. \nMeanwhile don\u2019t send eBay the iPhone, call the card issuer that you used and cancel the card saying it was stolen(bonus buy something with it before you call and claim it\u2019s stolen to get more free merchandise from whatever store you want). \neBay now can\u2019t charge your card and you already have the items you bought with the eBay voucher(pro tip use a drop address and fake name, use a prepaid card and PayPal to sidestep ebays limit on prepaid cards for backup payment methods)\nI\u2019ve done this several times and it\u2019s proven effective. \nTechnically I\u2019m homeless since I live in a van. Using this scam and shelter addresses helps make extra cash on the side. \n\n\n\nEdit*\n\nIf the scam is completed correctly you\u2019ll get this email, the voucher will be added to your account automatically, spend the voucher ASAP. During eBay checkout be sure to select it as a payment method if on mobile because for some reason it doesn\u2019t do it automatically. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/G3CC7lc](https://imgur.com/a/G3CC7lc) \n\n\n\nEdit 2* update. If I have time tomorrow after work I will try to make a step by step video on how to do this and upload it. To some people this may sound like lots of work for a free $500 some dollar eBay voucher but once you get the hang of it this can be completed several times per day within 15 minutes each time. \nTbh I\u2019m almost debt free thanks to this scam and lord willing for another few days it\u2019ll keep working and get me out of being homeless. eBay will catch it eventually (they did it with instant selling program they ran several years ago). That\u2019s why i am trying to show people how to complete it successfully. We need to maximize the amount of money taken until they catch it (because fuck corporate amerikkka;)\n\n\nEdit 3* video of step by step on what to click\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/6UeU3eW](https://imgur.com/gallery/6UeU3eW) \n\nAfter you make an eBay account and fake PayPal simply follow those clicks in the video and continue to list. After that it\u2019ll ask you to upload a picture of your iPhone, take a generic one off the internet. You should then be given an instant voucher offer. Accept that and repeat. It\u2019s early so I didn\u2019t make another new account this was just a quick demo vid.

If you want more, do this with more expensive watch models, make sure the watches you buy don\u2019t have a date and a magnification because these replicas are usually worse, make sure it only tells the time and has no additional complications that might be harder to copy on a replica.\n\n\n\nHere are some models you could use:\n\n\n\nRolex Oyster Perpetual \n\n\nRolex Air King\n\n\nRolex Submariner No Date\n\n\nRolex Explorer\n\n\n\nAll of these models should net you around 4-5K once you\u2019ve completed the whole process.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: buy real watch and fake watch, swap boxes, sell fake watch as real, sell real watch as used.", "score": 73, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9w6l9t", "name": "t3_9w6l9t", "created_utc": 1541964186.0, "title": "ILPT QUESTION?!

There's two methods to this ILPT, therefore. The first is that you go out into the country near you and steal a 45 or 55 mph speed limit sign, and throw the pole from it into a body of water. Unless you don't live in the US, all speed limit signs use the same bolt pattern. I used to just use a wrench and mole grips (not very fast) but just get two adjustable wrenches and some brake cleaner (and gloves) to be safe to take the sign. After that, find the sign you think will help your commute best and in the middle of the night, take it down and swap the speed limit signs. Again, throw the previous into a body of water or something. \n\nThe other method is just to remove the decreasing speed limit sign. For example if you're driving through a 45 zone, which transitions to a 35 on your journey, just steal the 35 sign and pole and you guessed it, chuck it into a body of water. \n\nNow the two methods can be tested. If you then get pulled over for \"speeding\" or \"reckless driving\", you can legally justify yourself in court as long as you're not caught  for the theft of the sign. Just go out and take pictures on your phone or a video of where the signs are placed (after you get the ticket if they check EXIF data), and present it at your court date. \n\nSafe speeding guys!", "score": 13, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9we10y", "name": "t3_9we10y", "created_utc": 1542029525.0, "title": "ILPT Request: how do i get the full refund for this ebay item while still keeping the item?", "selftext": "\"Thank you for your message.

I have asked to submit an Extenuating Circumstance form for this so I can get an extension and not be penalised but I basically faked a funeral attendance cause I went to Florida with my family for a week 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy boyfriend said I should talk about the funeral in the EC form and so I did and just submitted it... Like the idiot that I am, I did some reading and apparently, you need a death certificate or some coroners' report to get it properly accepted by the panel as it could well be hearsay. \n\nLuckily, I did actually go to the doctor earlier this week (before I knew about this missed deadline) for a rash and some other symptoms I was experiencing and my doc said I had a hormonal imbalance and prescribed me a new pill. So, I used that in my EC form too. The only issue is, I can't get a note from them until Monday cause the doctor isn't around - is it too risky for me to forge one considering I've faked a death in the family?\n\nI shouldn't have faked the death, I know, but the EC has been submitted so I'm doomed now. If they ask for extra evidence of the death could I potentially forge a death certificate? \n\nPlease keep your judgements to yourself.

So, it is very important to make it interesting and captivating, motivating this way others to stay at your account and continue overviewing your publications. \n\nEvery Instagram profile includes name, username, website, and bio. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00b7 *Name* should be up to 30 characters, easy in use and searching. It will be perfect to use a popular keyword while forming the name.\n\n\u00b7 *Username* should be the same or similar to the one you have used in other social networks. It will make easier and more comfortable for users from other platforms to find your account on Instagram.\n\n\u00b7 *Website* will be shown in your profile as an interactive link helping to redirect traffic.\n\n\u00b7 *Bio* should be up to 150 characters, demonstrating the advantages of your brand, as well as inspiring users to follow you.\n\n**Step #2: Use interesting and well-suited hashtags**\n\nHashtags make you visible and more noticeable. In order to get more followers, it is recommended to use narrowly directed, original and even funny hashtags instead of the most popular ones. This will help to reach your target audience and expand your followers. \n\nAs about the number of hashtags to use: Instagram allows putting up to 30. Someone is sure that 5-10 hashtags will be enough while others claim it is better to use all 30. If you can select 30 well related to your brand hashtags \u2013 just do it. It cannot be harmful anyway. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Step #3: Use paid services**\n\nTo get the desired results in the shortest possible time \u2013 try paid services. One of them is [Instagrowing](https://instagrowing.net/). It is a cool, cheap and reliable service!\n\nWith its help, you will receive:\n\n\u00b7 high-quality services,\n\n\u00b7 needed amount of followers,\n\n\u00b7 big range of offers,\n\n\u00b7 affordable prices,\n\n\u00b7 fast delivery,\n\n\u00b7 24/7 customer support,\n\n\u00b7 service guarantee.\n\nThese guys will do their best to make you totally satisfied with the results!", "score": 7, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9xlpur", "name": "t3_9xlpur", "created_utc": 1542371104.0, "title": "ILPT: If you discover someone has slashed one of your tires, slash your remaining three.

See the bank removes the fees if the transaction that overdrew the account is disputed and resolved in your favor. From experience the banks generally don't give the merchant a chance to respond for 10 dollar petty disputes, they just charge them back. So 711 lost 10 bucks but saved me 35 in the process. I mean they are a large corporate business so who cares. I have done this several times and thought id share because it definitely save money each time. Whats important here is that the transaction MUST occur on the day your overdrew the account for it to work. The dispute reason can be anything, but \"item or service not as expected\" is my personal favorite. Start with the small transactions because those are almost always successful.

What this will help you do is: A. Find the fuel type for that exact car, you don't wanna siphon diesel if you have a gas car do you? and B. Find the exact model and year to see whether it is likely to have an \"Anti-Siphon\" insert in the fuel fill tube (this is a piece of plastic to prevent us from siphoning gas by blocking long rubber tube shaped things). From this now given information, you can determine whether that car is a good target to siphon from or not, instead of just blindly finding any car and accidentally stealing diesel or find your tube won't go into the tank, and then getting your dumb ass caught. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy gas theft!", "score": 18, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9xq8sc", "name": "t3_9xq8sc", "created_utc": 1542402509.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST: LOOKING TO PURCHASE A HIGH END LAPTOP BUT DONT WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY FOR IT.

This method is simple and it requires an account that is new and has a record of making purchases at least for the last 4-6 months so you don't stand out as a red flag. Once you get enough cred that you aren't a red flag buy an item worth 15-45 from eBay/amazon, some people have had success with 100$ items but it varies, then once you order and receive wait a few days then call to return for whatever logical and rational reason. The person to which you are talking with will tell you to keep the item and not worry about sending it back. Then you list it on a website for a cheap price since its all profit anyway and SELL IT FOR CASH!, you could also try listing it in local sites such as craigslist.  If you followed the part of having an account that won't set off any red flags this method should work through the next 3-4 times. An additional tip is to hypothetically buy from seller with thousands of reviews, as hypothetically buying from people who are trying to get by and then hypothetically doing them shady will not only be unethical but would also have a higher chance of getting you behind bars.

Then I just wait for the customer support to comment giving me their email to further explain, from there I am contacted to the store owner who then offers me free shit. For instance, I made up a story on about pep boys that I took my car in when I had an appointment and the people said they didn\u2019t even have the tools to do the work on my car, and that none of the guys that following morning was the guy I talked to the previous on the phone. I also said that my appointment was actually never scheduled. When I finally got things going with the store manager I said this had happened a few months ago, which didn\u2019t change anything. I was given a free oil change, new windshield wipers, headlights, and even changed my transmission fluid. All for free. I do this with a lot of companies because it really takes 5-10 minutes out of my day to post the review and then I just wait. If nothing comes out of it, It won\u2019t matter because the story never happened. I\u2019ve received gift cards, great coupons, free services, and a lot more.

I've been using a GIS viewer to find some spots that are seemingly unclaimed, and I'm wondering if I can build on them. I have two different instances:\n\n* Instance 1: There is a small bank / beach on the coast of a populated island near me (pop. 5000 I guess?) and it's basically the other side of a small neighborhood, separated by a smallish forest parcel, owned by someone. However, this small beach area, including some trees is not owned. When clicking on it to view parcel and owner, etc. nothing happens. This means I think that the local County counts it as part of the river, which people cannot build on since it's water. Also this land does not seem prone to flooding from tide either. \n\n* Instance 2: There is a patch of forest in between two houses in a small neighborhood, however there is no address number on the area. Also when clicking on it, a parcel number is given but nothing else (owner, their address, land purpose), it is all blank. A search of the parcel number in quotations reveals a bid sort of thing from 2014, but I think it has been forgotten about. Also, in the local register of deeds, searching the same parcel number yields zero results. \n\nSo basically I'm just wondering if under South Carolina adverse possesion law, I can build improvements on either pieces of land and claim it as my own. From there I would build my cabin and enjoy it. Is this possible? Illegal? Help.\n\nThank you.

In the gas tank, oil, windshield wiper fluid, radiator fluid, tranny fluid, everything. Not too much to where the car dies, but a decent amount. This will completely total their car. Within a month, that car is toast. \n\n#2: Put a mixture of comet and Draino into a old plastic film container(the black ones, kinda like a pill bottle where one roll of film is placed, if your really young and have never seen one). Place your mixture into your desired gas tank. Over the course of 10-15min, the gas will eat through the plastic film holder. Your mixture of draino and comet will then have a chemical reaction with the gasoline, causing it to ignite, and blow up the victims car. Good thing you have 10-15 to get outta there. \n\n#3: On a hot day, throw slice of bologna, or meat, on their car paint. It will cook onto the car, and remove a circle of paint from the car when removed. Useful for people that park like jackasses.  \n\n#4: On a cold day, when it\u2019s freezing out, pour honey all over the car. It will mess up their paint job trying to remove it. \n\n#5: Put lube on their windshield wipers, so it just smears shit around. You could also throw something on the windshield that\u2019s messy so they are forced to use them right off the bat, and also to prevent that happening while they are driving, cause it\u2019ll blind them. \n\n#6: stuff a sock or shirt in the exhaust pipe, use a broom handle or stick to push it all the way in.  \n\nTip: when slashing ones tires, don\u2019t slash all four so the insurance company won\u2019t cover it. \n\nBetter way to syphon gas from someone\u2019s car you don\u2019t care about: don\u2019t use a syphon, that\u2019s just a pain. Climb under the vehicle and cut the fuel line. Take as desired. \n\nReplacement windshield: On the back of a semi, look around for the \u201chow\u2019s my driving\u201d sticker with the 1800 number, and call complaining that their truck slung a rock at your windshield. If they don\u2019t replace it for free, keep calling different companies until one does. You\u2019ll find one. \n\nFree gas in a pinch: most gas stations have a couple pumps where you can jimmy the gas out. Continuously keep trying to pump gas by squeezing the handle, and gas will keep trickling out. Now this takes a while, but will work in a pinch, and I\u2019ve yet to find a gas station that doesn\u2019t have at least one pump that will do this. \n\nTires: *works with proper insurance. if you get a flat or your tire gets slashed, slash the remaining tires to get a new set from your insurance company, most won\u2019t replace 1 tire, but will replace all four.\n\n", "score": 48, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zd1a9", "name": "t3_9zd1a9", "created_utc": 1542882787.0, "title": "ILPT: When enjoying the company of a hooker, prostitute or gigolo, make sure to film the action.

Best plan I\u2019ve ever heard.", "selftext": "Its all about the getaway vehicle. I saved the best heist plan for last, so skip to last 3 paragraphs if your just interested in that. But all the getaway vehicles are the same: a flying trike. \n\nflying trike! It\u2019s classified as an ultralight aircraft and does not require a pilots license, and also has no age restriction to use. Also requires a very minute amount of space for take off and landing and is capable to safely reach 4000ft \n\nPictures and stats of a flying bike (it\u2019s really a trike)\n\nhttps://m.hammacher.com/product/first-flying-bicycle\n\nObviously you probably won\u2019t get one that nice, but you can get a decent one for about 9 grand. It\u2019ll go 25mph, some go up to 45mph, and it generally has 75 miles in the gas tank, but when in the air you can turn off your engine to save gas and just float around until need be. They are also incredibly safe, if your engine were to die in air, you can safely land no problem. In fact there\u2019s no need to have the engine on while descending. Also you can carry an extra gas can if need be. But weight is a factor! \n\nIf cops are still on your tail, go lower so everyone can\u2019t see you from miles around. . Occasionally land here and there and try to escape via riding your bike on ground, and if the coppers catch up, just go back in the air! They have roads, and traffic. You do not. \n\nMake a game plan with your buddies, have them set up several enclosed trailers in set locations that are all hooked up and ready to go. When your in air, you can choose which trailer to go to that would have the greatest chance for you getting away, then quickly land and put the bike in the trailer, simultaneously your buddy closes the door and drives off. If he gets pulled over, or is about to, open that trailer door and ride your bike out on the street from the moving vehicle, throw out the shoot, fly off and try for another trailer. Compensate your friend well for his arrest. \n\nSay if you robbed a bank, and your in air with a duffle bag of cash, but there\u2019s not many good landing spots away from cops. Your thinking that you won\u2019t be able to get away with landing without being seen by cops. Well there\u2019s a couple solutions. \n\nOne is to also set up a drop zone for some other buddy\u2019s to be at, so if need be you can just throw the bag overboard, and they grab it and take off. Now when you land, if cops happen to be there and your busted, there\u2019s no more cash for evidence. If you do it right, you\u2019ll get away with it but if not, and you end up going to prison, at least when you get out, you\u2019ll still have the money! Unless your buddy\u2019s screw you over. \n\nTwo: this you can make as the soul plan, it doesn\u2019t require any partners so you can do a solo heist. Probably your best bet. Helicopters are not a problem in this strategy. Go on a couple day drive with 14 full 5gal gas cans a couple days before the heist. The # of cans would vary on the distance you are trying to travel, but that\u2019ll do for 1k miles. On your road trip, pull over every 75 miles in a good area, an area you\u2019ll be able to recognize from the air, and stash a gas can in a space where you know you can easily and quickly, land, refuel then take off. If in a rush just grab the can and refuel in air, and toss the can. Spray paint big X\u2019s near it if you think it will help spot it. Stash cans all through the US leading down to the Mexican border. Or up to the Canadian border if you choose. Make sure to have a extra 5gal of gas strapped in on your bike, just in case you accidentally miss a refueling spot. Now, when you fly off from the bank or wherever, you can basically nonstop keep flying until you fly over Trumps wanna be wall at the border. If you were 1000 miles away from the border, it\u2019ll take 40 hours of flying time to get there. But luckily you can take a nap on that thing, i would set an alarm for every 15 min just so you can open your eyes and make sure your still going where your trying to go. And of course make sure that your 4K feet up when you do. Boom, you just got away with a heist. And its basically impossible not to get away with it unless your engine went kaput, and again if it does you\u2019ll just softly float down to the ground. Also, if and when someone does this, it\u2019ll be one of the most epic and lengthy cop chases of all time and you\u2019ll become a legend. \n\nNote: keep in mind weight is a factor. From the sounds of it, most flying trikes have a 300-400lbs max payload. Assuming you weigh 200lbs fully clothed, you have an extra 5gal of gas (30lbs) have 20lbs of food for the 40hr flight, $1,000,000 in $100 bills weighs 22lbs. So you\u2019d have enough room to fit a couple million on the bike. Although 1mil would be enough to live off considering you make 6k a month from just have a mil sitting in your bank making interest.  So withdrawal 6k a month until you die! Then your kid will have a million, and they can do the same! Just always make sure you don\u2019t go below a million and it\u2019ll last you forever! \n\nBonus: when arriving in Mexico, purchase a fleet of flying trikes and send over an army of flying Mexicans to the states to rob a bunch of places, and then fly back.

You\u2019ll be released same day or sooner due to overcrowding. \n\n\nEdit* spelling ", "score": 85, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zik80", "name": "t3_9zik80", "created_utc": 1542925105.0, "title": "ILPT Request | How do I fuck over someone using a picture of them?", "selftext": "I was sent a photo of myself from this one asshole who photoshopped my photo into a pretty embarrassing one. \n\nWant to get revenge with the photos I have of him.\n\nAre there any good suggestions / photoshopping skills I can learn to fuck him over?\n\nEdit: grammar ", "score": 13, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9ziov4", "name": "t3_9ziov4", "created_utc": 1542926137.0, "title": "Pain", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zjo1k", "name": "t3_9zjo1k", "created_utc": 1542934665.0, "title": "ILPT: Nothing is illegal if you don\u2019t get caught", "selftext": "", "score": 82, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zjovt", "name": "t3_9zjovt", "created_utc": 1542934879.0, "title": "ILPT: It's not considered rape if she's dead.", "selftext": "", "score": 0, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zjr88", "name": "t3_9zjr88", "created_utc": 1542935449.0, "title": "Want some extra money?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zjxo6", "name": "t3_9zjxo6", "created_utc": 1542937079.0, "title": "ILPT Wanna make some extra money?", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zkc9t", "name": "t3_9zkc9t", "created_utc": 1542940750.0, "title": "ILPT: Amazon Refund", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "9zkcha", "name": "t3_9zkcha", "created_utc": 1542940801.0, "title": "ILPT Request | Pay hobo, etc. to take mindfuck revenge on a spousal rapist", "selftext": "Long story short: My first husband (the guy in my other post to this sub about carrying drugs across state lines... utter psycho) ended the marriage by raping me. Since I was drugged rather than beaten into compliance, there wasn't shit in the way of external evidence, and when he finally left town on a business trip a few days later, the victim advocate very kindly explained to me that even if there was enough left for a rape kit, all it would prove was having had sex with the guy I was (then) legally married to. She added that the local DA considered most such cases \"he said, she said\" and thus unwinnable, unless one dragged one's broken, bleeding near-corpse to the nearest hospital or cop shop five minutes after the incident. So, he got away with it.\n\nA little over a year later, he moved to Distant City, Opposite Coast. But especially given the case where the guy beat the shit out of his wife in front of their kids, served 9 months of a 2-year sentence, was promptly hired *by a city mayor* on release, and killed her this past week, it's a little hard feeling safe... PTSD is rough and when I hear about cases like that, it doesn't help.\n\nWhile I naturally have lots of ideas about how his physical body should be treated, it strikes me that it would actually be more satisfying to hire the proverbial hobo to fuck with his head in some way. Although I still remember his SSN for some fucked-up reason, that's pretty traceable. I was thinking about having the hobo find his bicycle where he parks it at Place of Work and steal, not even the seat, but *just one pedal.* And as soon as it was replaced, do the other one.

There is no need to lie about my qualifications. I am a truck driver. I have a commercial drivers license. I have a clean driving record. I simply need a character reference. Somebody that would verify that I did indeed spend the past year renovating my house.\n\nI would pay anybody that's willing to help $15 each. I would get the money to you once I'm hired. Please let me know if you are interested.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everybody that offered to help. I've gotten all the references that I might need. I start driving again next week.

Paid, and went to pick up the order, and they gave me the shake and mcMuffins and said, \"Pull into the first parking spot, and we'll bring your hashbrown out, it'll be a minute or two.\" So I did, and when I got it, there was a yellow coupon inside. It said something to the effect of, \"This is a speeding ticket! Except this time, WE'RE paying the fine!\" It went on, \"You should never have to wait at McDonald's. Redeem this ticket for one free dessert item or small McCafe drink.\" \n\nSo I was like, \"Okay, cool!\" When I was done, I went back through, and got another free Small Chocolate Milkshake, and I was gonna give it to my sister.

It\u2019s all there waiting for me to exploit. \nSo I simply opened a bank account using fake ID(you can literally make one online and tell the bank that you only have the paper copy while waiting to get it replaced- some will take it some won\u2019t- mine took 3 tries but Wells Fargo took it). So now I can go and navigate to a website called checkeeper. See this site offers a no credit card required free trial(which can be used repeatedly). I personally prefer this website but dozens of others exist like it. \nSo now I get my blank business checks out(amazon/ local office supply store/ steal em pay for em doesn\u2019t matter). Put them in your printer. \nScan a copy of your old paper paycheck. Use photoshop to cut out the signature. Save this. It will be needed later. \nNow use the account and routing numbers from your paycheck to apply to your forged check. Be sure everything matches. From the placement of the checks elements to the background. Now one of the most important steps is to change the check number. The company I worked for has roughly 200 employees on payroll. So to be safe I put the number 1,000 higher, meaning it should take a few months before they catch the duplicate presentment of a single check. \nNow *IMPORTANT*. When writing the check amount in, be sure to keep it misdemeanor in your state. See in California misdemeanor check fraud is 950 or less thanks to prop 47. So I wrote in 949.99. \nYou don\u2019t need magnetic ink for this scam because you\u2019ll be using mobile deposit. \nNext use your signature that was taken from your old paycheck in my earlier step, place it directly on the line where it would normally be. \nPut the payee info as the person who\u2019s name is on the fake bank account you opened. \n\nPrint out your legitimate looking check, detach from blank paper, deposit same into new account. \nMost new accounts will put a hold on funds for a few days. Nothing to worry about. If you followed the steps the check will clear just fine. \n\nAs of writing I\u2019ve deposited checks in amounts between 900 and 949.99 for 2 weeks straight. Each has cleared but I pulled the funds immediately just in case leaving less than 100 in the account. This has fixed my financial situation a bit too. \nIt\u2019s like 4 times the paycheck of a decent paying job, minus the whole working 40 hours and overtime part. \n\n\nIf you enjoyed my guide to check fraud and forgery you may be interested in my guide on how to get away with mass murder. Coming soon\ud83d\ude0f\nJk. Not actually committing mass murder\n\n\nEdit*12/14/2018 @ 12pm\nI wanted to take a minute to update with some advice. After reading some comments on this thread I would strongly advise that only a dual citizen, or perhaps an ex American living in a different part of the world other than North America, attempt or continue to do this illegal life pro tip. I will be leaving very soon within the next 10 days but for my own security I won\u2019t disclose the exact date until I\u2019m out of the country. \nI do believe y\u2019all when you say that one way or another you\u2019ll be caught eventually. It\u2019s more a matter of WHEN than it is a matter of IF. That said i can confirm that most states will not extradite out of the country for offenses like this one. For you to be entered into Interpol as an American you would need to have committed murder, child abuse(in which case I hope you end up in jail), an act of terrorism(in which case your already caught on the news), or be a high ranking government official or celeb with a high profile. \nI for one won\u2019t be extradited on various warrants past the state line. \nIf you have a way out go for it. But to take the advice of another redditor stop while your ahead. The ones who get caught always start doing it, realize how good the money is, then continue to do it for a while, then they\u2019ll say lemme stop before I get caught, then it turns into just one more time and I\u2019ll quit, then a shitload of time inside of a prison. Fuck Corporate America but don\u2019t be too greedy\ud83d\ude0f\n\n\n\nEdit. Update 12/14/18 8:45pm\n\nI wanted to point out to the ones who say it\u2019s a total amount of all the checks. You guys had me believing you until I googled it myself. Y\u2019all are actually incorrect under proposition 47 it is the amount PER check and not a combination of all checks. Hence why I said to keep each check under 950. \n\n[https://m.imgur.com/a/K9LEhbO](https://m.imgur.com/a/K9LEhbO) ", "score": 256, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a5ck8b", "name": "t3_a5ck8b", "created_utc": 1544572494.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST: refunding items from clothing brands and perfumes.

They barely have any cameras. And when they do, They are either TV style cameras, or hang down 360 camera. Here is the good thing, depending on what you want to steal, if it is near a TV camera, the angle might be terrible and you can get away with just grabbing it and sticking it in your waistband, you can always check if the item you want to steal is on the camera or not because it has a monitor to look at while you're stealing!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lets get to the 360 cameras, most of the stores I went to, I only saw these cameras in the back section / meat section. This means there are plenty of isles to take stuff from without being recorded. If you are wanting something, and the camera is there recording you, just grab it and go to a isle without a camera, and put it in your waistband, or you could grab another item that looks similar  to the same item you took and replace it where the item you are taking is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here are some extra tips I'm going to throw in!\n\n1. Do not look up at the cameras directly, this is a sure fire way to get caught / suspected of shoplifting. Just try to look for cameras from the corner of your eye.\n2. Don't bring some big bag with you, they will automatically think you are sketchy. Just make sure your pants are tight, wear a hoodie or a sweatshirt that goes a little over your waistband, and shove the small items in your waistband.\n3. If you want to be extremely cautious, make sure to bring some money with you and buy a smaller, cheaper item before you walk out!\n4. When I steal sometimes, I shove the item I want in my pants and pick up a gift card or something, and something along the lines of \"If the card for some reason does not work, is it refundable?\", The reason I do this sometimes is because 1, its a dumb question and obviously it can't be returned. They wont think a idiot would steal. 2, they think someone who was stealing wouldn't have the balls to come up and ask a question right in front of them with items shoved in there pants.\n5. Last tip, if you're stealing for the first time, DO NOT act nervous, the first time I ever stole something my legs were shaking and that alone almost got me caught. I shoved the item down my pants and walked out. I was like, no alarms? no people chasing me? This was really easy. I got over my fear of getting caught, now if I want something small like a snack from a gas station, I just put it in my waistband and walk out while they are busy or something. (By the way, if you couldn't tell by now, your waistband is a really good place to store small items.)", "score": 26, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a629aa", "name": "t3_a629aa", "created_utc": 1544768544.0, "title": "How can I have a foreign WhatsApp number (online) which is working and free of cost?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a62p25", "name": "t3_a62p25", "created_utc": 1544772673.0, "title": "How can I cash a check that doesn\u2019t belong to me and get away with it?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a64cde", "name": "t3_a64cde", "created_utc": 1544790063.0, "title": "Just missed your flight?

Not only that, he also regularly makes bomb threats, although he's never followed through on any of them. Overall, he's just a really unpleasant yet manipulative character.\n\nCall me a horrible person if you will, but I wouldn't mind if he was murdered by some random robber. Problem is, that's extremely unlikely, because the security is really tight, and he has lots and lots of bodyguards, plus he's practically in control of a private army.

For this you need a few things one is an auto body shop or a mechanic garage along with some accomplices and a lawyer to prepare a legal document.\n\nFirst thing you want to do is buy a bunch of cheap cars to sell on Craigslist. I am talking about real piece of shit cars you can sell for 800-1000 dollars. You are going to need to do this so you can meet with and gain the trust of several poor people who you need for your scam. Once you find some customers you can talk to them to build a rapport. Eventually to  ask them if they want to make 2-3 thousand dollars cash. The majority of them will say yes, if they ask you if this is a scam or its going to ruin their credit be up front with them. The majority of poor people don't have credit or don't give a shit about it since there is now way they are buying a house or even getting credit cards with more than a one thousand dollar limit.\n\nOnce you have an accomplice it's time to get him to a used car dealership. Most car dealerships especially used ones are absolute scumbags and they don't want you to buy a used car cash. They would much rather have you finance the car for a high interest rate and they get a percentage of your payments. Thats fucking great for us because we want a expensive car while spending as little as possible. We are going to be buying and registering the vehicle in our accomplices name. However you will be with him throughout this process as his \"friend helping out\".\n\nAt the dealership look for the most expensive vehicle you can get while only putting 2-3 thousand dollars down. Its really up to you here to negotiate but I have seen people walk out the place with keys to a 20,000 - 30,000 car. Now once you pick your vehicle your dealership is going to run your accomplices credit. A dealership usually has about 4 levels of creditors. The guys at levels 1-3 charge the lowest interest rate and they are usually big name lenders. The guys at the lowest level charge the highest interest rates and they small time lending companies. At this point you will either be rejected and have to put more money on the down payment or will be charged one of the highest possible interest rates on a loan (up to 24.99%). It doesn't fucking matter honestly because you are never going to pay this shit back anyway. Some lenders are also going to ask you to put the car into full coverage insurance DO NOT DO THIS. Tell them you already have full coverage and you are going to add your car to it and will have the paperwork after you get the vehicle.\n\nTake the car register it and add some shit liability insurance with your accomplice in tow. Now you can either let your accomplice drive the car for a month or proceed to the scam ASAP. From now on you are not going to make any more payments on the car.\n\nNow this is where the part of being an auto body shop or repair center comes in. Your accomplice will bring the car to the shop. There they will sign some papers stating that they got into an accident / mechanical trouble. They didn't file a report and are leaving the car here for repairs. Your accomplice will now be paid the amount he was promised so give him 2-3k in cash. At this point you should have spent around 6,000 and are now in the possession of a 20,000 - 30,000 vehicle. Of course now the fucking finance company is going to come looking for the car. Eventually they will realize its in your shop and come to your door however you can easily duck them for a month or 2.\u00c2\n\nOnce the finance company asks for the vehicle back show them the paperwork of the car being singed over to your shop. Charge them a crazy storage fee for everyday the car has been there. You can charge up to $500 bucks a day in some states. The finance company will now realize the owner owes more to YOU in repairs / storage costs than the car is worth and has no intention of paying. If they take you to court it will only cost them money / time and throughout the court process the car will continue to be stored at your location and will accumulate even more fees. It's a loosing battle for them so most of the time you just get to keep the car as a form of payment for your repairs. The owners credit will be ruined but it was most likely shit anyway.\n\nThere is a variation to this scam. Sometimes the finance company will put full coverage insurance on the car after the owner fails to deliver documents about its status. But it takes them a LONG time to do this (they will delay even filing for the insurance until a month). If the car has full coverage you do not give a shit anyway as you can still get tons of money for your ghost storage fees and repairs.", "score": 12, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a7fmv8", "name": "t3_a7fmv8", "created_utc": 1545169586.0, "title": "Help with faking a doctor's note?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a7frfz", "name": "t3_a7frfz", "created_utc": 1545170407.0, "title": "ILPT Request: Fake doctor's note?", "selftext": "Hey everyone, so I have an existing doctors note, but I need it to be one day earlier, anyone have ideas?", "score": 7, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a7frlq", "name": "t3_a7frlq", "created_utc": 1545170435.0, "title": "ILPT: when a man asks for your phone number at a bar, ask for his phone to enter your number.

It's not my mother tongue.\n\n**Introduction:** In march my ex gf and I broke up but since we live like 100m away, we stayed best friends because we got so much in common. This broke up wasn't good for me and it's still getting me sad and kinda controls my mood somedays. But I was happy I had her as a friend.\n\nAbout a half year before this broke up happened I found a new group of friends (no one of us knew anyone else in the group beside one couple). They instantly became something like a bf group. We did many things and even made vacation together. My gf wasn't in this group but I took her with me 1, 2 times. They didn't like her. She knew it. So they were happy we broke up. One day I got in a word fight with a friend (lets call him Dave) of this group. We planned something and said how we'd do it. Then he stopped sticking to this plan and wanted to expose us/me. I don't wanted it. He got rude and insulted me and I said I don't want to make anything with him anymore. I said the same thing to the group. Iam out if he's with us. That's the point where he started to hate me. He thought I wanted to make him bad so everyone stops doing something with him. So he started to get me out of the group. Which happened. I got best friend with the girlfriend of one in the group (the couple), they broke up (before we got bf) and then the other guy thought I got \"more\" with her. Which is kinda true, but not to this moment. I thought myself, fuck it. It was not such a big deal for me. But then something happened. And this is why I want revenge.\nMy then best friend, my ex gf which is really really important to this time. She helped me very much, and we did much together. She was the everyday life friend. You remember, they don't like her. But then they went to her and talked to her. \"He's suicidal and he got something with my ex gf (\"my new bf\"), he insulted you everytime he talked about you because you broke up. and so on...\" They said even worse things. A few days later without knowing I called her and wanted to invite her to something. She said, she doesn't want to make anything with me anymore. Later that day she went WITH THEM to this event I wanted to invite her on. My heart broke another time. Now she's with them, who tried to destroy my life. The woman I loved. They completely brainwashed her. This was the last day I saw her.\nThis was the worst day in my life. This happened about 5 months ago and I still keep thinking about it. Iam depressive because of this. He destroyed something very beautiful. I tried to get in touch with them. One guy was okay with me. I said him he shouldn't try something like that ever again. He was okay with that. But DAVE not. He's about 20cm smaller than me, not many friends and not very muscular. Iam. And still he insulted me on the phone and laughed at me. I tried to get to him. As soon as he sees me, he runs away or closes the door.\n\nI want revenge. I need to do something, which causes same things like he did. I want to destroy his life.\n\nWhat I know: I got his phone number, instagram, facebook, e-mail, paypal e-mail, his ex gf number and friends of her, his car number and normal things.\nHe's living here alone. He moved far away from home where his parents still live. His mother is kinda ill and he drives back home like every 2-4 weeks for a couple of days.\nHe got a work training and finishes it in a few months. I know that he often takes days off the work without him being ill. He's using apps like tinder etc. and Iam pretty sure he goes wild there.\n\nI thought about catfishing him, getting pictures of him naked and post them all around facebook & co. All that with fake accounts of course. Iam almost sure he will connect such things with me taking revenge and run to the police so I need to be sure he doesn't know its me.\n\nI also thought about informing his work he takes days off often without being ill or posting pictures on the street warning about him being a pedophile or something similar.\n\nI need your help guys, I need to get peace and this revenge could help me a lot\n\n\ntldr: Friend got mad at me and tried to destroy my life. Talked bad of me to my friends and brainwashed my best friend (my ex), which broke up with me after that. Now they're friends.\nWant to destroy his life, HELP!", "score": 13, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a7z8h8", "name": "t3_a7z8h8", "created_utc": 1545321311.0, "title": "ILPT: If you're short on cash, steal someone's dog and then return it for a reward.", "selftext": "", "score": 2215, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a7zaok", "name": "t3_a7zaok", "created_utc": 1545321687.0, "title": "ILPT - Make money by just downloading these apps (UK only)", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a80229", "name": "t3_a80229", "created_utc": 1545326001.0, "title": "Amazon Classic Mastercards", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a805z7", "name": "t3_a805z7", "created_utc": 1545326606.0, "title": "ILPT: If you are going to do any cybercrime, make sure you have good OpSec", "selftext": "I'd recommend this guide;  [https://archive.fo/ixpCz](https://archive.fo/ixpCz) .\n\nReplace TrueCrypt with VeraCrypt or any other good Encryption tool.", "score": 7, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a80a0a", "name": "t3_a80a0a", "created_utc": 1545327236.0, "title": "[Request] Can my CU tell if I have insurance on the loaned vehicle without me sending proof?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a80eit", "name": "t3_a80eit", "created_utc": 1545327966.0, "title": "ILPT Discord", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a81mvz", "name": "t3_a81mvz", "created_utc": 1545335064.0, "title": "Any reliable PAID websites to get a virtual US number for verification calls/texts?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a81qs2", "name": "t3_a81qs2", "created_utc": 1545335705.0, "title": "ILPT Request: Any reliable PAID websites to get a virtual US mobile number for verification calls/texts?", "selftext": "", "score": 10, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a8238k", "name": "t3_a8238k", "created_utc": 1545337751.0, "title": "ILPT: Getting a firearm across the country without a car.", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "a82x2s", "name": "t3_a82x2s", "created_utc": 1545342525.0, "title": "ILPT Request: I am currently rolling up a bunch of my change to cash it in.

If you're stealing a belt just put it on and make sure your hoodie covers it. If you're stealing a wallet just put it in your pocket or hoodie pocket.\n\nOnce everything is well hidden and you've checked the mirror to make sure you look normal, exit the change room with one of the pairs of clothes, leave the extra two, and go to the nearest employee.

It was around $470 worth of products. Not proud of it, but let's move on. I paid for 2 things and when I walked out, someone from the store stopped me and told me to come back. I gave back all the products and answered all their questions. I was quiet and cooperative. They said they wouldn't call the police but they did. Nothing happened, I signed something that said I was banned from the store for 5 years and the police officer first asked why I did it and that I was going to be arrested. Later, I was not arrested but he said I would have to go to court. The person from Sephora said that I was going to be mailed a letter with a fee. Is there a way to postpone the court hearing? I'm leaving the country on Wednesday and won't be back until August (and yes I am considering not coming back because I'm not trying to be arrested). I called an attorney for a free consultation and he said I would need to pay $5,000 for them to explain my situation and prove that I am not fleeing the country (since the court date won't even be processed by Wednesday) and then another $5,000 for them to appear in court for me.

I have stolen over $30,000 worth of items in less than 2 years. Let me tell you how.\n\nSupermarkets:\nEasy enough, bring an empty bag and fill it up but not completely full. Utilise multiple pockets. Do it in isles where there are pillars or just below the camera at the end of the isle. There are blind spots, find them. WEAR HEADPHONES. If using self self serving checkouts, and you want to steal that way by not scanning the item and putting it in the bagging sections, pretending you didn\u2019t hear the \u201cbeep\u201d will save your ass. Hide in plain sight. Don\u2019t walk around for ages just get in and get out and don\u2019t leave without buying something. \n\nKmart/Target/Big W/ Walmart etc:\nOkay same goes for these as the supermarket. But these larger shops tend to stock items that are too big for your bag, such as an air conditioner, speakers or a TV or a chair or whatever your choice is. Now, once you\u2019ve picked your item you need to first go to the checkout and get a pack of gum or a chocolate bar and KEEP THE RECEIPT. Go back and grab your item, this time place the receipt on the edge of the box or whatever and walk out with your headphones in. The staff can see that you have a receipt and literally just walk out, it won\u2019t beep.\n\nClothing stores:\nIf they have no sensors, just fill your bags and walk out. Change rooms can be used to put clothes on, jackets can be worn out, shoes on feet, shirts under jumpers etc. if you can smuggle it into the change room then you can get it out of the store.\nIf they have sensors, you need to time your exit with people coming in and out. Never look around like an idiot being like oh was that me that beeped? Keep walking, they will not chase you. I talk about how to remove tags below, once safely at home.\n\nDavid Jones:\nOkay this place is on the trickier side of things. They use tags and everything will beep when exiting the store. If it\u2019s perfume/makeup or something you just rip the sticker off and walk out (grab the tester bottles too those are free!). Okay how about a handbag? Once you have it you need to leave the store fast, two ways to do this. Phone call talking very loudly or again, the headphones. Do not underestimate how powerful this technique is, trust me it has never failed. No one wants to disturb you especially if both your hands are full.\nLeave the item in the freezer overnight with the tag wet having been rubbed in water. In the morning get a hammer and smash it, it will break immediately and pliers will remove the rest. They are just plastic but compromised immediately once frozen.\n\nJB HIFI:\nThis is now going to be the hardest one. They have active security in all stores and will 100% check your receipts. Unfortunely headphones won\u2019t work for this one. For this you need a bag, which will act as a decoy. Empty bag with like gym stuff in it or whatever will take the heat off. Any items small enough to fit on you should be put either down your pants or in a seperate pocket in your bag than the main one (they won\u2019t dissect you or your belongings). If you have a larger items like a microwave or coffee machine or mini fridge, this is actually easier. Ask the staff for a floor receipt (this is what you use to take to the counter to pay for when items are too large to scan). All you need is the company stamp (can be purchased online) and then a signature. Bring a trolley in and wheel it out. While the security is checking the receipt either a) have a friend outside telling you to hurry the fuck up, b) phone call and immediately get hostile, c) you are dizzy and need to sit down quickly. I\u2019ve done all three of these many times and they all work. I\u2019ve taken flat screen Tv\u2019s and a washing machine.\n\nFinally, you are ready to be a ghost. Is this the hardest one of all. You are going to go into the stock room dressed in a nice suit, wear no blazer and put a high visibility vest on instead over a collar shirt. Carry a clipboard with the details of defective item(s) you are going to steal. Walk in, no one will stop you or ever look twice, (a loud phone call here works too). Wander around the loading dock area, take the items you seek and walk to the loading dock. This works best if you know where the exits are, you do not want to communicate with anyone.\n\nThis can not be done very often so do it wisely. You can also call the store and ask them to put it on hold so you know where it will be.\n\nWell guys, there\u2019s more I can teach you but that\u2019s about it from me today. I want to get my life back on track, I\u2019m going out on top.\n\nTL;DR: List of ways to improve your everyday stealing, and how to heist larger items.

The thing is that because we already know what to write about and how long the essay etc. should be, we can fully prepare the essay but unfortunately, we cannot bring it with us. There is one thing though we are allowed to bring, 5 sources.\n\nBefore we take the exam our teacher will check all sources to see if students did not secretly write their entire essay in it.\n\nThe essay has to be 800 words (+/- 10%) and as I said I can bring 5 sources. These sources cannot be too long, but I think 1 A4 page/source is good.\n\nI really need to ace this essay. I was wondering if any of y'all have a way how I secretly could write my essay in these sources? I was thinking of this method but I think it will take a lot of time to make and needs to be perfect otherwise the source will make no sense.\n\nI could change the sources in such a way that each first letter of each word would make a word from my essay. For example, a word in my essay would be ''people'', so in my source, I could edit the sentence to: ''paper estimated over players leave every''\n\nAs you see each 1st letter makes the word 'PEOPLE'. This is a very time consuming and inefficient way, also the teacher will see that the source makes no sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone know a better method? THANKS\n\nEdit: I have to type the essay on a computer which is restricted to open any other program than Word. All I can take with me are the printed versions of the sources\n\nEdit 2: I printed out the essay in font 4 and took it with me. No one saw it when I pulled it out.

She has intimate pictures of her boyfriend's ex girlfriend. For some reason, this current girlfriend is very hostile towards my friend (let's call her S) - the ex-girlfriend - even though S has never done anything to her, S doesn't even know the girlfriend personally.\n\nFirst it was blackmailing, then the woman actually started posting those pics for real, S went to the police (2x), was laughed at (both times, after the police looked at all her nudes, she was told she shouldn't have sent those pictures to her then boyfriend at all).\n\nThis woman has a circle of other people, and they keep following S around Facebook, spreading lies, which could be, at this point, considered slander. But the police in my country refuse to do anything.\n\nThe boyfriend keeps providing his current girlfriend with material, right now she got an access to voice messages of S singing, and that's now used against S, she's being humiliated. \n\nS tried to block them, tried to ignore them, they make new accounts, they always find a way.\n\nS is afraid to do anything at this point cause she's afraid they'll release her pictures again or that they get more aggressive.\n\nAll I could think of was that I'd get more people to report their accounts, eventually the FB algorithms might get them zucced, but they'll come with new accounts, they already have more, and they have secret groups on FB, so I can't get into it and report the content.\n\nI could just make a post (I do have a good following on my FB), like, where I'd say what I've just typed here, released their names, make them sound bad, okay, people would share, and what then? Nothing.\n\nThat's why I am asking here. Have you ever dealt effectively with cyberbullies? I know the simplest answer is \"just block them lol\", but it's kind of uneasy feeling knowing they're out there on FB spreading rumors about you and having intimate material of you.\n\nI am sorry if this doesn't belong here. I don't want go to legal pro tips. Because I don't trust them. And S doesn't want to go to police again, because it's useless.\n\nIn all honesty, I think that if I don't figure anything else out, me and some more people will visit the boyfriend and his girlfriend and fucking explain to them that they better stop (and hope they get scared cause if they don't then they'll continue and I don't really wanna go to jail over beating this bitch up, which I'd have to do if they don't get scared). It lasts for so long and S is getting tired.\n\nThe fact that she, the current girlfriend, is doing it for fun and out of weird hate towards women from her boyfriend's past makes me wanna slap that outta her. The fact there are people who support her and help her do it, the fact the boyfriend is enjoying it so much... it all pisses me off.\n\nThank you for reading and I apologize if I posted into not correct subreddit.

I got into this in college to make extra cash - it was awesome, but time consuming.\n\nAnyway, back like 6 months ago, I had this one paypig (that's what we call the submissive idiots who are into giving you money) who gave me all his logins and passwords - namely that for his chase bank account. He's a moron and has given these credentials to at least a dozen guys I know of, so random IPs logging into his account is nothing new. He refuses to change the credentials and all the other guys can't get shit because they're all broke, dumb and Romanian or something.\n\nDude also happens to be a douchebag and wasted a ton of my time. He talks to so many doms (the guys who *take* the money) that I wouldn't ever be a suspect here.\n\nQuestion is: I still have the credentials. Dude makes like 120k/year. I know when he gets paid. Is there a secure way to go in and clean him out? Maybe via a VPN at a public library? But where to send the money to? The exit-point for the cash is where I really get stuck.\n\n**tl;dr** I have the login credentials for a well-off asshole's chase bank account. Is there a way to clean it out without getting caught?\n\n**BONUS:** I also have the credentials to his coinbase account. The only hang up is the phone number verification/two-step ver. when you sign in from an unrecognized device. Is there a way around this? Because if there is, I can generate a new BTC address and just max the shit out of his CC for them instant crypto gainzzz\n\n**Bonus #2:** I also also have dude's CC with all info needed (CCV and billing address included). How can I use this without fucking myself as hard as I'd be fucking him?\n\nThanks, fellow bandits. Trust me, this dude deserves to have his money taken; he's a fucking asshole and if you saw what he did with his money, you'd agree it's better off with a reprobate asshole like me.

Great for expensive items. Tried and tested by yours truly, PuzzledYam.\n\n\n1. Buy and pay for item. (don\u2019t forget the receipt). Put item in car.\n\n2. Go back in and grab same item. Walk to Customer Help and ask them to print a gift receipt for item you just bought. Show receipt for proof.\n\n3. Item will come up with error when scanned hasn\u2019t been purchased yet). Employee will get annoyed and will hopefully either a. surpass the error somehow or b. be confused and say they can\u2019t give you gift receipt. Both result in you getting a second item completely free. \n\nAlternative Method...\n2. Go to different Walmart. Grab same item, ask to return it. An error will come up. Act confused, agree with how odd it is. They will most likely apologize for the inconvenience, and this is when you exclaim you will just try to return it at the Walmart you originally bought it at. Grab item and leave. Boom, free item.\n\nMy experience...\nBought a Kurigg Coffee Maker ($170) from Walmart. Did the first method, the worker was confused at why the error came up. I think she felt rushed and wanted to help me, so she just pulled out a gift card, put 170 on it then proceeded to \u201cbuy\u201d the coffee maker and printed a gift receipt. Thanked her and was on my way. Ended up returning both, so got a free $170 gift card.\n\nKEYS:\n- Items can not be locked up\n- This works best with smaller to medium sized items\n- Do it during a busy time when there\u2019s a long line.  Whoever\u2019s working the desk just wants to help people swiftly without much issue so they wont worry about specifics\n- Dress nice, be friendly (very key), and most importantly... bring out your acting A game!! Be confused, you\u2019re just trying to get gift for someone after all. \n\nKeep in mind!!! \nMethod is not perfect. Could easily fail, but if you bought an expensive item and wanna try it like I did, the risk is relatively low compared to other methods. Be smart about it.

Grab item you want and go pay for it. (don\u2019t forget receipt). Put the item in your car.\n2. Go back in after a couple minutes and grab the same item. If it fits in Walmart plastic bag, put it in while no ones looking. If not, doesn't matter. Walk to Customer Help and ask them if they could print a gift receipt for the item you just bought. You want to \"give it as a gift but forgot to ask for one\". (You will have the receipt for proof).\n3. Item will come up with an error when scanned (hasn\u2019t been purchased yet). Help desk employee will be confused and will either a. surpass the error and print out gift receipt for new item or b. be confused and say they can\u2019t give you a gift receipt, at which point you say no big deal, and take the item and walk out. Both result in you getting a second item completely free.\n\nAlternative Method... 2. Go to different Walmart. Grab the same item, ask to return it. An error will come up. Act confused, agree with how odd it is. They will most likely apologize for the inconvenience, and this is when you exclaim you will just try to return it at the Walmart you originally bought it at. Grab the item and leave. Boom, free item.\n\nMy experience... Bought a Keurig Coffee Maker ($170) from Walmart. Did the first method, the worker was confused at why the error came up. I think she felt rushed and wanted to help me, so she just pulled out a gift card, put 170 on it then proceeded to \u201cbuy\u201d the coffee maker and printed a gift receipt. Thanked her and was on my way. Ended up returning both Keurig's so got a free $170 gift card.\n\nKEYS:\n\n* Items cannot be locked up\n* Works best with smaller to medium sized items.\n* Do it during a busy time when there\u2019s a long line. Whoever\u2019s working the desk just wants to help people swiftly without much issue so they won't worry about specifics\n* Dress nice, be friendly (very key), and most importantly... bring out your acting A game! Be confused, you\u2019re just trying to get a gift for someone after all.\n\nMethod is not perfect. Could fail, but if you bought an expensive item and wanna try it like I did, the risk is relatively low compared to other methods. \n\nHappy lifting.", "score": 24, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "air79k", "name": "t3_air79k", "created_utc": 1548189637.0, "title": "ILPT Request: How to get free Nintendo Switch", "selftext": "Whos got the best method.\n\nFrom any big box store, online or in person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 4, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "airtcx", "name": "t3_airtcx", "created_utc": 1548192629.0, "title": "[Request] I ordered 4 razer phones yesterday and only one came is there any way I can get the other 3?

Replace/upgrade an old electronic. Ideally, this would be something like a busted controller or an older sound bar. I would suggest something that costs <$200 to replace, but you do what you feel comfortable with. Buy the replacement and within a week bring back the old electronic in the new box with the receipt and get your money back. If you can open the new item without messing up the box and replace the tape so it looks unopened then just say the item was not what your niece/child/cousin wanted and you get the money back no questions asked.\n\nOption 2. Buy a more high-end toy or electronic for the price of a cheaper one. Ideal for VR headsets or boxed toys. Again I'd keep it under $200. Buy both items, put the cheaper item in the more expensive item's box, return. Again if you can make the box look unused it's much easier. Either way, just say it's not wanted/incompatible and bring your receipt.\n\nOption 3. Use someone else's receipt to get free stuff and cash. This could be by done dumpster diving in theory, but you could just check carts and the parking lot for lost/forgotten receipts. Check the receipt for something worth your time. Ideally a single item worth $50-$200 after tax. Go to Walmart's app or website and search the number next to the item on the receipt. This way you know exactly what you're looking for. Find the item and put it in your cart. Grab a few other things to actually buy so it doesn't look like you just did what you did. Go to customer service and say you wanted to return something and ask if you can buy your items while you're there. You get free stuff and some cash.\n\nOnly do this a few times a year and switch Walmarts and shifts if possible.", "score": 124, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "ajdrbm", "name": "t3_ajdrbm", "created_utc": 1548345255.0, "title": "ILPT-Request", "selftext": "How can I listen in on police radios in my local area in the UK \n\nWhatever is the easiest and cheapest way is preferred ", "score": 11, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "aje2wu", "name": "t3_aje2wu", "created_utc": 1548347126.0, "title": "ILPT: selling a house?

Pay with a valid credit card. Raise no red flags. Then down the line we get a call from the credit card company telling us to void a fraudulent charge.\n\nWorked EVERY time.

Mostly to make me seem like slightly less of a cunt. \n\nA few years ago I was made homeless and started living in my car. Times were hard, but I was still working a low paid customer service job. After just a few days, not being able to shower or launder the few clothes I had meant that I had some very awkward odour questions to answer at work. I explained the situation to my boss, and was promptly dismissed. Thanks dick head! \n\nSo now I've got no money, no job and I'm living in a shitty beat up car. I can't afford to eat, drink or smoke (disgusting habit, but fuck it). I'm more stressed than ever and need to find a quick free way of sorting something.\n\nI have genuinely used each and every one of the tips below. I can't speak as to whether these will work for you or not, but they did for me. The legality is probably questionable, however for me the need outweighed the punishment.\n\nFirstly I moved my car into a fairly well lit Burger King carpark. This provided free WiFi for my phone, a comfortable toilet and free gadget charging. Beautiful. If you're nice to the staff, they'll sometimes give you a coffee or burger for free too. Be polite, and move on if or when asked. That's entertainment, safety and basic hygiene sorted.\n\nDominos are brilliant. I would emailed their customer services to complain about a pizza I'd not actually ordered. I made out like it was the worst pizza ever, and was compensated with a \u00a320 code to use online. This code worked 5 times before it got cancelled. Rinse and repeat with a new email for a new code. Collect an order with the code to get a 6th.\n\nI used amazon a lot, and got items delivered to my local church. I had an initial \u00a330 gift card which I used. Then complained that nothing was delivered and was refunded onto another gift card. This sorted some cheap clothes, camping stove, a saucepan and sleeping bag. Rinse and repeat to keep the money going. I did monthly topups on odd bits and bobs to keep me warm and comfortable. \n\nEmailing any customer service dept usually reaps rewards! From experience, Mars, CocaCola, and Kraft all post out free compensatory vouchers when you complain. Dont do it too much as they'll wise up quickly! \nI took a picture of these vouchers on my phone, then used MS PAINT at my local library to make similar looking replicas of these. I used the original Barcode from the vouchers so that when printed, they can be used (if done properly) at self serve tills in Tesco and Sainsburys etc. Some staff will allow them but others wont. This ones risky but can be very rewarding. They will take the total voucher amount off the subtotal of your shopping, so buy whatever you need. Free coke and chocolate was nice though! Again, staff notice this fairly quickly so be very careful!\n\nGregg's, Subway, Pizza Hut, KFC and Kraft all have great customer services,and will hand out free food or a voucher for most complaints. Just be nice to them when emailing and they'll be happy to help. Remember to alternate names and email addresses when doing this more than once.\n\nI was also able to trade a few ill-gotten tins of Mars Celebrations to a kebab van, and a few other local takeaways for the odd hot meal.\n\nI was able to take advantage of a new gym membership, however some gyms are very nice and understanding and may be able to help. Please don't scam gyms, just ask to use their showers once in a while and they help you out. Similarly, some barbers will give you a quick trim if you simply ask and tell them the truth.\n\nI did a few more things to get by too. I had free tobacco whenever I needed it, got a new laptop and could eat (almost) anywhere I fancied for free. \n\nAfter a few months using these techniques, I was able to gather enough stuff that I started selling things on Facebook. If you can get 12 tins of celebrations using vouchers, they will sell online for around \u00a325-30. It's not gonna make you rich, but when life's tough every pound helps.\n\nI'm fortunately no longer in need of these techniques, though some may be. I ask anyone using these for themselves to maybe consider helping someone less fortunate near you. Maybe offer them a bit of food you've scammed, or some shit amazon gave you a refund for?\n\nFinally, be smart. I used to alternate between shops, takeaways, pubs - wherever I was scamming, I'd hit it once per fortnight and always at different times and days. Anything done online was done with a different 'disposable' email address. I NEVER took anything from an independent trader, only corporations who make enough profit to not notice me taking a tenners worth of stuff.

Take 2 items of clothing off the shelf - one that is the incorrect size, one that is the correct size. Tell cashier you received the incorrect size item as a gift and want to \"exchange\" it for correct size. Leave without paying a dime.", "selftext": "Originally posted in ULPT but I think it fits better here.\n\nI actually thought of this back around Christmas time. I had received some clothes as gifts and many were the wrong size; I liked the clothes so I decided to exchange them for the correct size rather than return them and it really showcased how easy this would be. **Biggest realization: Most, if not all, department stores don't require a receipt if you're making an exchange. Walk in, take 2 of the same item (different sizes) off the shelf and \"exchange\" the incorrect size for the correct size.** More detailed steps below:\n\n*Step 1*: Bring a bag with clothes in it into a department store. These can be legitimately purchased clothes, or could just be clothes from home that you toss into a plastic bag. This is literally just a prop, you're doing nothing with the clothes in the bag. Do this to make it look like you're just another shopper.\n\n*Step 2*: Find an article of clothing that you want. **The piece of clothing can't have one of those plastic anti-theft detectors on it** \\- this limits your options but not by much. (The general idea is that you're \"bringing in a piece of clothing to exchange\", if you were actually bringing in a piece of clothing that you had been gifted, it wouldn't have an anti-theft tag on it.)\n\n*Step 3*: Take 2 of that piece of clothing off the shelf, one that is the size you actually wear, and one that is the wrong size that you will be \"exchanging.\" You can slip the incorrect size into your bag or just carry it with you, I don't think it really matters.\n\n*Step 4*: Head to the cash register and say, \"I got this \\[piece of clothing\\] for \\[Christmas, birthday, etc.\\], but it's the wrong size. I'd like to exchange it for this one. I don't have a receipt - I hope that's alright.\" It will be alright. Cashiers don't care enough and most people don't include the receipt when they give a gift to someone.\n\nYou're done at this point. The cashier will ring up the incorrect sized item as a return and then scan the correct sized item which will balance the transaction to $0. You're all set - you leave with the clothing that you didn't pay for, and you even get a receipt to take with you.\n\nJust thought of this as I typed it up: Now that you have a receipt, you could potentially return that article of clothing for in-store credit to use towards something nicer. Although you wouldn't necessarily need that receipt for that either, just change your wording in Step 4 to: \"I got this \\[piece of clothing\\] for \\[Christmas, birthday, etc.\\], but it's the wrong size. It's not really my style so I'd like to return for in-store credit rather than exchange for a different size. I don't have a receipt - I hope that's alright.\" I don't see why this wouldn't work as well.\n\n\\*\\*EXCLAIMER: I haven't actually tried this yet, I have only done an actual exchange. It was so easy to just walk in, take what I needed off the shelf, and go up to the register to make the exchange without a receipt that it should work for anyone without a hitch - as long as you don't look like a shady fuck while you do it.\n\nBest of luck!", "score": 30, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "alqxuw", "name": "t3_alqxuw", "created_utc": 1548950667.0, "title": "[ILPT Request] Running away tips?", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "alr2mu", "name": "t3_alr2mu", "created_utc": 1548951397.0, "title": "Money.

Leave me a PM or comment if you have any other questions.\n\nSo the last post was over the 3rd party AppStore called Tweakbox. Tweakbox injects ads into these free apps that they host in order to keep their service running, but there is another service out there that doesn\u2019t inject anything into their signed apps. The apps are just signed with an enterprise certificate and the ipa (app) is not modified at all.\n\nBefore doing this make sure the original Spotify app is deleted or it will not install. Ignition has tons of other awesome apps like Spotify++ on it too, so don\u2019t think your options are limited.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 1: Visit www.app.ignition.fun/\nStep 2: If any ads pop up push the X on one of the top corners.\nStep 3: Go to the second tab and go down to the \u201cTweaked\u201d category. \nStep 4: Go down to Spotify++, Tap it, then press the \u201cGet\u201d button.\nStep 5: Press install when prompted.\nStep 6: Go to your home screen and wait a minute or two. If it still hasn\u2019t started downloading just tap on it once and it will. \nStep 7: Go to Settings -> General -> Profiles or Profiles and Device Management, then tap the certificate there and press trust.\nStep 8: Login on the new app and enjoy Premium features.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInfo for nerds:\n\nSo the most typical kind of code injection would be via dylibs. A really good write up is here: \n\nhttps://medium.com/@kennethpoon/how-to-perform-ios-code-injection-on-ipa-files-1ba91d9438db\n\nOne way to tell if dylibs were injected into an ipa would be to open the ipa up as a zip file on a computer and look into the app contents. Another thing that you can do is to change the app binary, and this is very very difficult and not something that happens very often unless it\u2019s for hacked games and things of that nature. \n\nHope this helps everyone.

This is how I get TV shows, movies, and music all for free, easily.\n\nFirst, the #1 rule of illegal downloading, always use a VPN service, so you can't get DMCA notices from your ISP. There are many VPNs, but the ones that are the most TRUSTED and SECURE ones, are NordVPN and PrivateInternetAccess. This is the only \"paid\" thing, but it's worth it and will protect you from getting pesky DMCA letters and snooping. It's about $2/mo for PIA, which is cheap. There's also Windscribe, which offers 10GB per month of free data, and you can create multiple accounts to bypass the 10GB limit. You just have to delete the registry keys for Windscribe when switching accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSEFUL SOFTWARE:[https://www.qbittorrent.org/](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) (Torrent client, open-source and safe)\n\n[http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) (Allows for easy downloading from direct-download sites)\n\n[https://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo) (Allows you to check the information about a media file)\n\n[https://mpc-hc.org/](https://mpc-hc.org/) (Media player, what I use, simple interface and easy to use)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMOVIES:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's torrents. A lot of people would say ThePirateBay, but I really barely use TPB. Instead, the #1 I hit up for movies is [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to). It's a torrent site, just like TPB, but it's a lot safer and more easier to use. Rarbg has trusted uploaders, so no worrying about malware. I will also discuss the #2 place. Then just search for your movie, and you'll find a few releases. Now find the one which is the right quality and size for you. Usually for mobile viewing a 1GB 720p file should be fine. If you plan to watch on a TV, a 4GB or higher file is suggested. Open the torrent link in qBittorrent, and make sure your VPN is on with a killswitch. Then download your movie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some other sits I hit up for movies and TV:\n\n[https://1337x.to/](https://1337x.to/)\n\n[https://zooqle.com/](https://zooqle.com/)\n\n[https://tpb.party](https://tpb.party) (As a last, last resort)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTV:\n\nFor watching TV shows, the #1 place I hit up is [forum.snahp.it](https://forum.snahp.it). It's also the #2 place I hit up for movies and games. It's a forum where people share direct-download links, or DDL. These are on-click downloads which instead of torrents, are downloaded from one server instead a whole flock of people. This means it's faster and safer, and you don't need a VPN for DDL. They have movies, TV, music, games, software, and pretty much anything. Simply sign up for an account, search for your show or movie, find the one which is the right size for you, decrypt the link with [base64decode.org](https://base64decode.org) if needed, and copy the link into JDownloader2. Then you can download the folder of the show or movie to your PC. This is my favorite method to download free shit and [snahp.it](https://snahp.it) is the SHIT for TV.\n\nFor #2, [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to) is also OK for TV. It's a torrent site, so you'll need a VPN if you want to use torrents. DDL doesn't need VPN, torrents do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for live TV. This is a little bit harder to do. Now, I know this is \"IllegalLifeProTips\", but here's a legal and ethical LPT which is quite worth it. For about $30-50, you can buy an antenna that plugs into your TV, and can actually pick up HDTV channels like NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox. Every city has it's own set of TV stations, and they can be accessed for free with an antenna. I get about 50 channels using this, and it's actually pretty nice. News, weather, etc, all for free and legal. You can even use a papercilp if you live close enough to the towers, but I wouldn't suggest it. There are antennas for as low as $10-25 even on Amazon. Here's an indoor flat antenna with a 35-mile range, which plugs into the back of your TV, for only $19: [https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Indoor-Flat-TV-Antenna/dp/B075ZQXB26/ref=sr\\_1\\_9?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1549429320&sr=1-9&keywords=antenna](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Indoor-Flat-TV-Antenna/dp/B075ZQXB26/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1549429320&sr=1-9&keywords=antenna)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this won't pick up cable TV networks, like ESPN/HGTV/TLC, and things like that. However, there is a free way to get cable TV channels. There are 2 Android APKs, [LiveNetTV](https://www.livenettv.to/) and [Mobdro](https://www.mobdro.sc/), which allow you to watch streams of lots of cable TV networks, like Nick, ESPN, HGTV, TLC, and so much more. You can install them on your Android device and cast to your TV, or if you have a Fire Stick or Android TV device, install it on there. However, the quality of these streams is not that great, with lots and lots of digital compression and blocks affecting the picture. But it's free, and fuck $170/mo for TV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMUSIC:\n\nMusic is pretty simple. I use [Deezloader Remix,](https://notabug.org/RemixDevs/DeezloaderRemix/releases) which with a free [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/us/) account, can be used to download complete FLAC albums from Deezer's server, for free. It also allows for MP3 files, if you think FLAC files are too large. The quality is great and sounds perfect. You can also use the torrent and DDL methods for getting music, of course. However, if your music is only on YouTube, you can rip it using [YouTube-DL](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). It's a free program that will download YouTube videos, and allows for ripping just the audio:\n\n`youtube-dl -f --extract-audio bestaudio <LINK TO VIDEO>`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, that's how I do it. That's how I get all my media, for almost completely free. The $2/mo fee from a VPN is totally worth it, since Netflix sucks ass starting at $8/mo. Also the one-time purchase for the antenna is worth it, as you can get a lot of content from local TV, I'm surprised nobody knows about over-the-air HDTV.

I later learned that she crossed into his yard and \u201cfelt threatened\u201d, keep in mind, she\u2019s less than 10 pounds against a 200+ pound grown ass man. My second mom walks out to call her inside and sees what happened. She asks Nani isn\u2019t moving, and he says \u201cFind out yourself, nigger.\u201d Yes, we\u2019re a black family in a predominantly upper class, white neighborhood. He\u2019s a hick, a real one. We call the cops, one of them I know personally because he\u2019s the dad of a girl I go to school with, and he taught us some lessons there. Anyway, they say there\u2019s nothing they can really do about it. That\u2019s all I needed to hear. The man crushed her spine, broke her neck, and damaged her brain. Unfortunately, she survived it, not for long though. We took her to the vet where she passed away that night. We paid for everything, but fortunately we raised some money for the bills. Nothing more came of it, and we eventually gave up because nobody seemed to care like we did. Every few days, I\u2019d go outside and I\u2019d have these fits of very serious anger and dread at the same time. He got off without a damn scratch and there was nothing I could do about it. We have since moved away from the neighborhood, about a thirty minute walk. He still lives there. \n\nI want to somehow get some form of revenge for our dog. She never got the justice she deserved, I feel I owe it to her. What can I do? \n\nMuch appreciated.\n\nEdit: The support I\u2019ve received is incredible and I\u2019d like to take the time to say thank you for that. I\u2019ve noticed many in the comments point out how he\u2019d take any excuse to kill me, and I\u2019m not gonna act like a badass or some edgy kid trying to be cool, but it really doesn\u2019t bother me whether or not he kills me, it\u2019ll be more trouble for him. I mean, a redneck killing a black teenager, how well do you think that\u2019s gonna go over with the media? He\u2019ll be destroyed by the public. Of course, I don\u2019t really WANT to die but if something like that happens, it happens. Another thing,  my sisters made a few posts on social media and tried to get the word out, as precision stated, we raised money to pay for the vet bills, and then that was the end of it. I\u2019ll definitely be taking some of these comments into consideration. Thanks for having my back, you wonderful people of ILPT.

Without going into much detail, one of my elderly family members called out my boss saying there was nothing stopping one of us into taking trade secrets and opening a new store without an NDA. Next day, all employees including myself signed one, with an indefinite term.\n\nThis was several years ago and now my boss couldn't be bothered to either leave his home or the bar to work a full day. He spends more time at the bar than I spend time at the shop, and I get overtime. He constantly goes back on his word, saying things he's going to do but never happens. He occasionally tries to make us feel pity for him by bringing up how he's been super depressed or how his insomnia quote \"prevents him from distinguishing reality from a dream.\" He has no recollection of several events to which I have perfect memory of. I have not gaslighted him, but I swear he does it to himself\n\nI've had enough of his bullshit. He refuses to sell the shop to me but has stated if he gets arrested for driving drunk, he would close the shop down.\n\nWe have video surveillance within the shop set up to record 30 days of video, then delete the footage. I know where the NDA files are located. I have two business credit cards (for buying supplies) and also take home the cash sales at the end of the day while recording deposits (occasionally a few dollars go into my wallet as an inconvenience fee). I also know that he never checks security footage or security alarms, as there has been an instance where there was a break-in at 4am and he didn't even know about it until 2pm that day after I had been blowing his phone up to wake him up.\n\nMy situation is this; He knows I signed the NDA as it happened years ago, however what are the legal implications if the document was destroyed?

She wants to beat me up and I\u2019m honestly a really small and weak girl (we\u2019re both teenagers btw) but hold on to this post I\u2019ll explain it better, I just suck at writing introductions\n\n The reason why she hates me it\u2019s because I\u2019m friends with her boyfriend. I would NEVER have anything with him, and I never even talked to her before she started to hate me. Also they were dating for like one week at the time, I mean, chill the fuck out. \n\n Well, it got so bad that the cops were called and she was arrested and is now waiting for trial in freedom. The judge probably won\u2019t be very harsh on her because we\u2019re minors but that\u2019s kinda unrelated \n\n She has to respect conditions before trial. She has to be 20m away from me, can\u2019t talk to me in any way and can\u2019t talk to one of the witnesses. Well, she doesn\u2019t cares at all. She loves to brag about how cops are useless and she\u2019ll never have consequences because \u201cI\u2019m a fucking minor and she (she: me) ain\u2019t gonna do shit\u201d (that\u2019s a shitty translation of the ways she speaks, English is not out first language) \n\n She\u2019s right about the anxious piece of shit, I really do have pretty bad anxiety and THATS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP. That fucking brat can\u2019t play with my life like that. Sounds like I just have personal beef with her, but you\u2019ll have to trust me when I say that I didn\u2019t even knew she hated me before she started to plan on fucking me up (she said that her goal is to deform my face for forever before I even knew her name????) \n\n She can\u2019t play with my life like that. I was already going though a bad phase before she appeared outta nowhere to threaten me. I\u2019m open to illegal, the only thing I CAN\u2019T do is talk to her cause that\u2019ll put ME on trial. \n\n Any suggestions?

Robbing a weed shop in Seattle.", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve never robbed anyone or anything before but I\u2019m looking into it as a possible career if this goes well. \nWeed shops, dispensaries, pot shops it does matter what you call them. They have 2 things weed and cash. \nSince they can\u2019t take credit cards they are forced to have cash. Many have minimal or no security (and even if it\u2019s one security guy- do you think he\u2019s risking his life over someone else\u2019s money?) I wouldn\u2019t nor would most logical people. \n\nNow I\u2019ve watched a few videos with pot shop robberies in Seattle and noticed several things. \n1.Poor quality video footage. I can look at the entire video footage 3 times over and find 100+ people I saw that evening that look and wore similar clothing with exception of the mask. (But I heard your supposed to ditch the mask after the robbery). Poor quality video footage is a common trend. \n2.  Lack of arrest and prosecution of suspects. In an industry that has a shady past, a questionable future, combined with the facts that it\u2019s  in a high crime city like Seattle means most robbers using a mask and gloves aren\u2019t being caught. In high crime areas lack of quality evidence and easy to pursue leads results in the police looking for the suspect for all of 15 minutes, a useless video online and the suspect walking free. \n3. The Seattle PD has been so kind to me. They normally mark warrants as \u201cno extradition\u201d and refuse to come get people past the state line unless they commit murder. Robbery? Caught? Just go to Portland and catch a flight to Hawaii. They won\u2019t use intrastate extradition. As someone who knows how easy it is to escape justice by crossing a state line it\u2019s useful to know. I really do love their style I mean look they even posted a nice webpage showing all the police response times for priority 1 calls. Lean closer to armed bank robbery, murder. That type of thing. A couple of dash and grabs at a pot shop place it closer to priority 2 imo. Either way that\u2019s 6 minutes on average. Yes 6 minutes from the time the store employee hits the silent alarm to the time the cops show up. Maybe if we find a pot shop near some construction that\u2019s always going on in this city we can up the police response time by using it to our advantage. Parking our getaway car a few blocks over out of the traffic means the coppers will be stuck behind a flagger guy as we make our getaway. \n\n\nWhy am I posting this? Well simply put I\u2019ve never robbed anyone before. Im actually living in a hotel and moneys about to run out. As a career criminal who specializes in fraud I\u2019ve got so many warrants in other states that gainful employment isn\u2019t on the table. The other states refuse to extradite me. After all I didn\u2019t kill anyone so it\u2019s cheaper to let me become another states problem. Follow the money. \nSo I\u2019m actually looking for a partner in crime. Maybe not a Seattle native. Truthfully I think I\u2019m leaving this expensive city after the robbery. Also I don\u2019t have a car. So we\u2019ll need that. I can hit up a drug dealer and buy a cheap gun or two for the armed part. Should be able to score it for around 1k. \nSplit 50/50. \nPersonally this is good for someone with robbery experience, someone with nothing to lose and everything to gain. Rob a convenience store after dark? You\u2019ll walk out with $100. Worthless even if you aren\u2019t caught. Meaning you\u2019ll have to do it again. Greed gets people caught. They rob it once and repeat because the money is good. Let\u2019s both not be greedy. Let\u2019s get as much money the first time flee the state and not worry about being caught. Period. \n\nYou ideally \n18-30\nOwn car\nCriminal experience. Robbing preferred. Not looking for petty shoplifters. If that was profitable I\u2019d be shoplifting for a living instead of just my weekly grocery walkout. 1000 is nothing. \n\nWilling to teach. Briefly. I\u2019m a fast learner and learn better from doing it not watching it. \nKnow how to aim. If we have to shoot someone let\u2019s aim for the chest, legs you know somewhere that\u2019ll disable but not kill. I said robbery not murder. Murder isn\u2019t my style and if I\u2019m getting 25 to life for a murder I want to murder my enemy not a random person. Especially since you only get to do one. \nNot a Seattle resident. You\u2019ll probably want to leave after we split the cash but that\u2019s up to you. We split 50/50 and go our separate ways. \nI don\u2019t know your name and you don\u2019t know mine. \nLeave your iPhones at home or your hotel. Let\u2019s rock those retro looking Nokia phones after I snag a couple from Target. Unlocked. Disposable. And if your bored after the robbery they do have an updated color version of snake. \nHave humor. I\u2019m a funny criminal. Let the victims relax a bit now. It\u2019s easier for them to think about the code to the drop safe when they aren\u2019t scared for their life. \nBe willing to cut to the chase. Walk in the store and go right for the cash. Let\u2019s not go through the whole \u201cthis is a robbery\u201d speech. Once we pull the gun they already know it\u2019s a robbery. Duh. \nKeep robbery times quick. I\u2019m not an expert. As I said I\u2019ve never robbed anything before. But I\u2019ve done enough research to know the average police response time is 6 minutes. Let\u2019s keep the robbery to 2 minutes. Maybe use a diversion beforehand. Use a prepaid phone to call 911 and report an active shooter situation in the same neighborhood. Say the U district. Say there\u2019s some guy shooting at UDUB. That\u2019ll put all the pigs in the campus area at the school. Ditch the burner driving by the school. Now you\u2019ve got extra time to hit up the pot shop in the same district. \n\n\nSeattle PD response times\nhttp://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/calls-for-service-dashboard\n\nAlright. Inquire and apply within my fellow felons. Let\u2019s rob someone. \n\n\n\n", "score": 0, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "arujv6", "name": "t3_arujv6", "created_utc": 1550473794.0, "title": "ILPT Request- Get someone arrested for their unregistered gun.", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "aruqmt", "name": "t3_aruqmt", "created_utc": 1550475311.0, "title": "ILPT Request: How to transfer money from a visa gift card to a bank account?

I wasn't, so I placed the order again and this time the charge went through. Great!\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nI come home today and I see two large bags sitting at my doorstep.

I am f\\*\\*king pissed.\n\nI want revenge, I want to get my money back for one pair of the shoes while keeping both. I tried contacting Foot Festival's customer service and first told them that I have been double charged. They email back and tell me that I had placed two orders and that because both of them have been shipped there is nothing they can do. I sent them another email saying that I only received one and I have not heard back from them. Should I try taking this up with Payapal and dispute it there?

And throwaway account. \n\nSo a day ago in the morning I come out to my car to find a note on the hood of my vehicle, it's in two different colors. Marker saying \"learn to park asshole\" and in pen says \"use a pen like an adult.\" So one can guess that the car, parked over the white line parked next to me thinks I wrote this note.\n\nGranted I was inside my apartment, except for when I was walking my dog which I take a path that has camera coverage, and I have cameras inside my apartment. So either one of those would show me carrying a piece of notebook paper or passed out on the couch drooling you'd figure. So I return the note back to the car and write \"idk who you are but this isn't my note you probably pissed someone else off.\"\n\nAnyways, later that day around 5 I come out my apartment and a guy is coming down the stairs at the same time, my front door faces the stair well so guy knows where I live. Usually no biggie, I know the neighbors that come down that set of stairs as it's on the end of the building, as well as what they drive and we get along and keep each other updated on random news. Think nothing of it. \n\nLater that night around 10 I go to my car to make a snackage run, this same guy I see standing by his car like he's just getting in or out of it, but he looks at me and sees me get in my car. I come back from snackage retrieval and car is still there so guess he didn't leave. I park my car at 11 and my vehicle was in tact. \n\nCome out this morning (7 hour window) and my antenna is gone. We don't get much traffic in this parking section, and remember I'm on good terms with neighbors so I know the people who park here except for this random person. I'm pissed off, and call apartment about this giving them details they said they won't even attempt to contact him without me filing a police report. Fine whatever. I get home and I pass this guy in the parking lot I don't say too much to him except for \"you realize I didn't write that note right\" he responds with \"oh I figured it was you maybe you had trouble getting out with how I was parked\" whatever dickwad. \n\n\nI let him go upstairs first, he takes the stairs by my doorway, and I pretend to mess with getting my mail. Few minutes later what do I find, my antenna bent to all hell outside my door. Had to be this guy. \n\n\nSo I filed a police report against this dickweed and they're going to charge him with criminal mischief. \n\n\nI've decided I'm moving once my lease is up in a few months, even though I've been here 3 years with no issue until this new guy moved in, pretty much all the residents around here have been here 3+ years. However I have an extra undocumented fob to the complex I won't turn in, I know where the camera blind spots are (where he parks is pure blind spots, I've since moved my vehicle in perfect view of the cameras and now have a dash cam with parking mode that I'll have running 24/7), so I can still access the complex even after I move out. \nI want to fuck with this guy, beyond the $500 fine for criminal mischief, how should I go about it? I'm thinking take the valves off his tires out one at a time so he has to make multiple trips and time out of his day to have them fixed as well as hurt his wallet.

If you are the lazy type that wants to make a bunch of money really quick, this is not the guide for you. If you don't mind a bit of work and are not in a haste, then read on. This guide would give you a steady moderate to high steady income, can be done from any country, and the best part is, you'll have a really happy ending. Who doesn't like happy endings? This can be done by a\n\nI call it the digital service triangulation method. DSTM for short. Lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's get to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnlike some carders that like to do the difficult stuff, (the Gcs, amazon, expensive electronics, WU, and other stuff like that), I like to keep things simple. I typically look for stuff that is easy to card and exploit them for the most profit possible. For instance tickets carding. But this is a different approach than tickets and it is pretty better.\n\nYou must have heard about sites that offer services online like seo optimization, graphics design, writing, etc. We would be carding these sites. Now I am not talking about freelance marketplaces like Fiverr, upwork, [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com). I am talking about professional sites that have real staff and offer these services exclusively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy these sites:\n\nSimple: because they are usually very easy to card because they don't typically have people try to card them. Think outside the box right? Or isn't that thinking inside now?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do we exploit these sites?\n\nWe use the theory of triangulation. That is, we advertise our own service and get people to order them, then we turn around and hand these orders over to the service rendering sites we have picked and pay with stolen ccs. Easy right? Not so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing. Time is of the essence here. The Chargeback problem. You see if the chargeback hits quickly, then we wouldn't have received the order we placed on the site. So here are  a few tips to avoid that. \n\n1. try as much as possible to get bins that take longer to chargeback. \n\n2. Pick a service which has a short turn around time. Something that takes usually within 1-3 days to complete.\n\n3. These sites usually have an option to finish the job faster. They charge extra for that but you aren't really paying for it are you?\n\n4. The time space between when the customer has ordered your service and when you push such order to the specialist site should be as short as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat tools are needed?\n\n1. Website\n\n2. Ecommerce setup (preferably stripe)\n\n3. Ccs\n\n4. Socks\n\nProcess:\n\nBasically you want to start with picking a service to render on your site. Pick wisely. Some services will not work with this method. \n\nafter picking a service, go ahead and create a website for said service. try to make it professional. It'll help in retaining customers. Next, you need to add a payment processor to the site. I recommend using stripe because it comes in handy for our happy ending.\n\nNext you want to Market your website. This can be achieved by carding adverts and/or seo optimization. I leave this one to you to figure out. But it is very key in this setup. Without it, no customers. It really isn't difficult.\n\nAs soon as orders start coming in, you card your target sites and deliver to your customer on time. Remember a happy customer will return and maybe even bring  other ones. Now just keep doing this for as long as you can. Your site isn't really at risk of being shut down because no one knows you card your stuff. So you can keep this up for as long as you can. Maybe even turn it into a real business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow many people want to ask: how long till you start making money out of this: Well as little as 2 weeks. But a more realistic time frame would be a month\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow how much can you make from this on a monthly basis? Well it all depends on a few factors.\n\n1. the type of service you choose\n\n2. How well you market your service\n\n3. How long you've been running it.\n\n All these being said, even if you don't run it perfectly, you should make at least $15k monthly with about 2-3 hours a day.\n\nAnd now for the happy ending:\n\nIf you have been running this for a while and for whatever reason want to stop, then you can get some good money from an exit strategy.\n\nremember your stripe account. It has been well aged with lots and lots of legit transactions passing through it. All you have to do is load that shit up with fake transactions and cashout several thousands.\n\nAlso, the bank drop you've been using by now has been well aged. You can also send fake checks or ach transfers to it.\n\nFinally, if you had created a legitimate business in this US for this (in another persons name) you could use it for all sorts of credit cashout. Be creative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I took the time to write this, I have deliberately chosen to leave out a some details. These details can mostly be obtained if you do some little research on your part. If there is anything I forgot to add, I will try to edit this post appropriately as I remember.\n\nCheers.", "score": 16, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "atitbx", "name": "t3_atitbx", "created_utc": 1550849002.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST is there anyway I can get an inactive Instagram account deactivated", "selftext": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "atiwip", "name": "t3_atiwip", "created_utc": 1550849485.0, "title": "ILPT: if you go to a place with several \"dial\" lockboxes, write down the numbers displayed on all of them and then try those numbers on the rest.

Looking for revenge", "selftext": "Okay so this is a bit of a long story but I'll do my best to explain it clearly. About 1 month ago there was a business card left on my driver window saying \"hey you, you park like an asshole next time I'm going to key your shit.\" I saw this and laughed and presumably thought someone had bought a stack of these from like a Spencer's at the mall or something and was putting them on people's cars as a joke. I had been making my own parking spot occasionally, but everyone does that here and I never parked in a way that prevented anyone from leaving, or even close to hitting anyone's car or anything of that nature. In fact when I got this note left on my car I was parked in a normal spot.\n\nOk skip forward about 2 weeks later I come out to my car and bam my entire driver side has been keyed front to back. Once again I was parked in a legal spot when this occured. Luckily I had been parked in a spot near the gate where there was a security camera. I had the apartment manager pull up the footage. At 10:25pm you see a man leave his apartment and get in his car to leave. Before leaving he goes over to the construction area to grab a cone and attempts to \"save\" his spot. There is no assigned parking here. It is illegal for him to do that. At 10:30 you see me pull up and get out and move the cone back where it belongs and park in the spot. (My apartment manager confirmed with me that I did the right thing by moving the cone back and that i certainly should have parked there) alAt 10:45 you see the same man go out of his way to walk by my car holding is arm out keying it from back to front. All this is was caught on camera, but the camera is very low definition and it was dark out. Thus all you can make out from the footage is that it's a man, and then you get a clear view of the car he drives from when he originally left. I also know which building he lives in, and that it's the first floor of the building. (This is because he entered and exited the building where only first floor people can) however you cannot make out his license plate bc of the camera quality. I just know he drives a dark colored Honda Civic that frequently parks near the spot I was parked in that night. My apartment manager recognized the car on the security footage and pointed it out to me. I filed a police report and the police officer said that even though it's a 99% chance it was him, she cannot fully confirm it due to the low security footage and so that she really can't do anything about it. She just said \"that sucks man.\" \n\nSo I know the car of the guy who did it, and what building he lives in. What would you do in my situation? I've considered confronting but if he is psycho enough to key my car over a spot he illegally try to save who knows what else he would do. I'm also afraid if I did anything to his car what he might do back to mine. I am medical student so I don't want to risk getting in big trouble trying to get revenge as I've worked hard to get where I'm at. At the same time though, I reaaaaallly want to get this guy back. I can't just let him key my car and get away with it, also with note he left, has he been like keeping track of where I park or some shit? Idk. I'd appreciate any suggestions from you guys, thanks!\n\ntl;dr  my car was keyed and I know the car of the guy who did it. The police wouldn't do anything about it.

He was subletting in the unit above me. He spoke only Spanish. I am Mexican but it wasn't my best language by far so I had to use Google translate for everything. \n\nHe asked for a place to stay since the woman he paid to live with was moving out. I noticed she had sublet a few people at a time, so he could have been telling the truth. I let him stay for pennies compared to rent elsewhere. I gave him my living room for 350 dollars a month. I was paying 1k for my own room, and my housemate paid 850, just to give you an idea of the kind of stress I was relieving off of him. \n\nHe stayed with us and worked a lot. Hardworking dude, he was. I leaned Spanish off of him while he learned English. I talked to him about my breakups, his breakups, his family, my family. Made as good of a connection as we could with what little language we knew from each other and Google. \n\nOne day he got injured. Needed a stomach surgery. He took out a loan to pay for it. A huge one. He stayed on my couch for a month, all while in debt and promising to pay his months rent when he could. I trusted he would. After that month he got back to work and paid off his past due rent plus the next months rent when the next month passed. Trustworthy, that one. \n\nThe only reason why he took out the loan was because his employer told him if he could get citizenship the company would start the process of getting a Medicare grant of 30k. He told me this after everything had happened. Showed me a picture of the check he got but couldn't cash since he wasn't a citizen yet. \n\nSince he was in debt and couldn't  pay for anything, He promised to pay me back 900 dollars if I gave him 600 up front. I did because he paid his rent like he said he would. Assumed he needed it to get through his tough time. This kind of thing kept happening, him asking for money and promising to pay back an even larger sum once he got the money from the government. Had no reason to doubt until 6 months had passed. He moved out and to another place in town, which he told me where. Then moved again but didn't tell me where. I had to find out by asking. He changed numbers. Didn't tell me. All while owing me a debt of 4.5k dollars, which was promised after me handing him around 2k dollars. I lost track. \n\nWhen 2019 came, he vanished. His numbers disconnected. He moved. Idk where he is. Don't know anybody who knows him. Got his income tax papers in my mailbox. Left it alone until I really felt like there was nothing left to lose. Saw that he actually got only 20k dollars from Medicare. He cheated me.\n\nI only have a picture of his license plate, vehicle and a couple of cell phone numbers he used alongside a phone number of a mutual friend who is in good standing with me. Just don't know how to find people with just that information. I fear he went back to El Salvador to his family to escape his debt. Any advice would be great. I'm in debt and need that money back.

If you aren\u2019t careful, you can get blacklisted (like me haha from ups) so internal investigations are were they ask their warehouse and carrier are where they ask your carrier.

He went onto a deep web market (Wallstreet market look it up), and bought 5 counterfeit $20s for $30 from a vendor called swimnotes who has tons of great reviews. Four days later, they arrived in the mail, with two extras. They looked impressive af even without any work done. After a quick cycle of doing a light coat of hairspray, and a thin layer of non-white deodorant, rinse repeat then some aging, they were ready to be used. He went out to a not-so-local mall that he never goes to, waited for the place to get busy, then went to a couple of places in the food court that were mobbed at the time and ordered $4-6 worth of food. Each bill passing flawlessly. Not a single cashier checked. They were hella busy, after all. Next he went to a couple of those center kiosks where people try to sell their cheap stuff. Passed off another couple bills spending about $6-7 at each. Even stopping by the girl scouts table, wanting some cookies. After about an hour and a half, each and every bill was passed. What he had of $30 turned into $140 in counterfeit $20 bills, then those turned into roughly $110 and some change of legitimate money. At the end of the day, the main character made some good money, and went home. \n\nEdit: he has been dubbed Bill Landry.

I do have a part-time job that pays well enough for me to afford my own contract, given there isn't some ridiculous, dumb fee beyond whatever is stated up-front. I'm also aware that if my parents find out, they will be able to call the service provider and have the contract terminated, although I'm not worried about this as an upbringing with plenty of mistrust and enmity has made me quite capable of hiding things from them, figuatively and literally. Preferably, I will end up with something better than just calls and text on a flip phone.\n\nAre there any loopholes I can exploit to get this contract, or will I have to just wait out the five weeks? Can I convince a provider that things will be okay for five weeks, or will I have to wade deep in deceit? Also, what are the legal consequences if my cover gets blown?\n\nIf more information is required to answer this question, please feel free to ask me.

It was \"sold and shipped by amazon\".\n\nHere, Amazon ships with their own shipping service and they put the packet in front of the door or somewhere in your front yard if nobody opens. So he didn't open and 10 minutes after the packet was delivered, he retrieved it.\n\nA few hours later he went onto \"report a problem\" or something like that and chatted with a person @ Amazon for 10 minutes, explaining that the tracking says the package is there but there's nothing. They asked him to ask the neighbors and he said he already did but nobody has the packet. They said they'll ask the carrier (here in our city they actually always ship with Amazon shipping) and that it will take max. 3 days. The friend opened a new chat 2 days later, they told him to wait one more day.\n\nThen, 3 days after the initial chat, he got an Email saying that they are very sorry the item was not delivered and that they sent a new one. He quickly replied asking if he could get a refund instead and they quickly replied saying ok, canceling the re-delivery and the order was marked \"canceled\" in Amazon. They told him it can take up to 10 days for the money to be in the bank account but it only took like 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this is his experience, relatively simple just a bit of chat and a couple E-Mails.\n\nHe would also like to ask if anyone has ever tried large / more expensive items like 4K TVs.

If you\u2019ve got a VPN, set it to a far away country (Venezuela is my recommendation with NordVPN). Install iTunes but do not log in, or, if you have to, create a burner account.\n\n\nSTEP ONE\n\nOnce the phone has been taken, diable Bluetooth, wifi and cellular data AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN, set it to plane mode and shut it down BEFORE LEAVING THE SCENE. This avoids tracking of your escape route.\n\n\nSTEP TWO\n\nOnce you\u2019ve returned to your place, disconnect your computer from the internet and then start iTunes. If you want to be extra careful, before connecting the iPhone to iTunes and restarting it, wrap it in 2-3 layers of tin foil, this will block the GPS chip decently enough (dunno if this actually works, heard about it online). Connect the ill gotten iPhone and reset it.\n\n\nSTEP THREE\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll see if you\u2019ve got a paperweight or a few hundred dollars. Once it has been reset, you should see the famous \u201cHello\u201d screen. Now you want to set it up to see if there\u2019s hope. If you got it setup no problem, then great! If it asked for the previous iCloud password... well you won\u2019t get caught, but the phone will be unsellable as is.\n\n\nSTEP FOUR, CASE A\n\nYou got the phone set up without a hitch and logged into a new iCloud account. Profit.\n\n\nSTEP FOUR, CASE B\n\nWell I hope you\u2019re tech savvy. You\u2019re gonna want to take apart the entire phone to be able to make a buck. Everything can be sold if it\u2019s in a good state, but the motherboard will have to be sold and mentionned as bricked (unless you wanna scamm as well, but you might lose the money)\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nOnce an iPhone has been stolen/found, you\u2019ve barely got any chance of being caught.

See many states refuse to pick up their wanted felons from a state away. I have warrants in 2 states but they refuse to come get me past the state line. Follow that $$$. Their last line of defense was to deny my passport renewal because I frequently left the country before. The obvious theory is that I\u2019d come back on my own if I wanted to be able to travel. Washington state issues an enhanced ID and enhanced drivers license good for border crossings in Canada and Mexico. They will issue it regardless of your extradition or warrant status. I know because I told the guy at DMV I had a no extradition warrant (yeah it sounds dumb but if they\u2019d deny it anyways I didn\u2019t want to pay the $80+ fee)anyways he told me it doesn\u2019t matter. 5 days later it comes in the mail and has been used successfully at the Canadian border once. The state of California wasn\u2019t the one that asked to deny my passport. It was the state of Delaware that asked for it. So you had 2 states and the feds with many chances to prevent me from leaving the country as well as many chances to extradite me. But all those attempts fell like dominos to Washington state. If your warrant is no extradition do expect 50% of the time to be briefly detained when you come back and get flagged. They\u2019ll see no extradition in the NCIC as let you go unless your in the state your wanted in. \nNote that this doesn\u2019t have to be for arrest warrants only either. Maybe you owe our awful government a shitload of taxes and they denied your passport for that or maybe you owe child support and they denied it for that. Either way Washington state has a way out for you. As a bonus you can pack up and leave for Washington anytime if your already homeless in your state. I am not sure about other states that issue enhanced IDs because I only needed to get mine in Washington state. Note that if your drivers license is suspended (hey maybe that warrant was for your 5th DUI;) you can still get the enhanced ID.  For those not sure how I am an unwanted felon please google the term \u201cunwanted fugitives\u201d. You\u2019ll come across a dated USA Today article explaining. According to the police in Las Vegas there\u2019s a guy wanted for 2nd degree murder that California won\u2019t pick up past the state line. Nothing really changed after the article in fact I dare say it got worse. See before you hold someone accountable for their crimes you have to check your wallet;)\n\nAlso although I\u2019m not wanted technically VPN was definitely used making this post for you FBI agents wanting to find my current location and reconsider extradition.

His boss says he hasn't been to work since the day he left, since he couldn't successfully steal the bike (see below: tried) and never managed his money well enough to get himself a car. He just mooched off of my BFF until, by his own actions, she had nothing left to mooch.\n\nWarning: LOOOOONG\n\nI'm on mobile, but I usually pay attention to what I'm doing, so no apologies for you!\n\nFor some needed context, my best friend/roommate/ex girlfriend was dating a guy she met through me, a dickwad who was unofficially adopted into my family, from about the end of October until last month.\n\nIn November, her and I moved in, temporarily, with him and my mom to both get the kids somewhere safer than where we were living until we could find a big enough house and to help take care of my mom, who is disabled and has no income currently. These facts are tied into everything that went down.\n\nIn November, maybe a week after we moved in or a little more, his car was repo'd because he stopped paying on a title loan completely. He claimed he had to in order to cover my mom's bills, and so my friend, who was head-over-heels in love with him and totally obsessed, let him use her truck. Unfortunately, she lost her job (her and I worked together) in early December, so I could no longer ride with her to work. Instead, he would drive me to work in her truck, then go straight to his job as a Jimmy John's delivery driver.\n\nIn January or February, we wiped out on black ice on the 270N outerbelt. It was bad, the front end was crushed like a can when we hit the guardrail and most of the force was distributed through my side - the passenger. The rear axle even snapped on my side despite the impact being front-right of center. I still have lasting back pain and  bad peripheral neurophathy as a result which may never go away.\n\nBy this point, I had a lot of resentment for the man who was essentially my adoptive uncle for much of my life. He stole away my best friend, who spent all of her time locked away in a bedroom with him or with the kids, he stole away the love of my life - the one that got away - and flaunted it in my face by deliberately being more physically affectionate with her when I was around, and if he had paid any attention to the vehicle in front of us spinning out too and me SCREAMING at him to watch out instead of reacting at the last second, mere feet away from the other vehicle, going 65mph, we wouldn't have wrecked out at all. I am, however, a doormat. Throughout all of it, I kept completely silent on my rage for the sake of everyone else being happy and to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nWith the truck gone, he lost his job. He got it back one month ago when my mom's bike got fixed and she let him use it.\n\nIt escalates from there.\n\nHe is known to have a prior cocaine habit and I can't judge, because I do the occasional line myself, but one night, I was laying awake in my basement suite, and heard the door from the kitchen to the stairs and back door open. I saw his boots and pant legs cross the landing and go outside. I know it was him because his shoe size is almost twice that of the next largest in the home and he is the heaviest by at least 50lbs.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, the back door was left wide open, and it was freezing cold. My space heater and electric blanket couldn't touch that chill. He vehemently denied ever going outside, and she took his word immediately. He convinced her it must have been one of her kids going out. I can't say for sure what he was doing, but I still suspect he did coke on the back porch (because that's where I hide to do mine or smoke a J)\n\nThe lying about small shit continued. His grown daughter invited him to a baby shower in early March, and he said he wouldn't go. My best friend practically had to force him to go to his only daughter's baby shower for his first grandbaby. He then lied compulsively, to her, about what he had said TO HER! He claimed he never told her he wouldn't go. He began gaslighting.\n\nJust a week ago, she caught him cheating on her with one of his exes. She confronted him, and he still had his phone in hand. I still don't know all the details of what he was doing on the phone, but it pissed her off enough she knocked it from his hand. His response was to grab her and slam her into the front door hard enough to crack a bone in her hand.\n\nWhen he left, he tried to steal my mom's bike.\n\nHe began harassing her, saying he knows she wants him and needs him and much as he does her, and that he will never leave her alone. He changed her nickname in messenger to various pet names and \"\ud83d\ude0d\" emojis, claimed he would be back soon to collect his belongings and drop off $40 of the several hundred dollars he owes me for covering part of his share of bills/rent since December. He also owes my best friend the same amount for the same reason, not to mention the KBBV fot her truck, which was about $7-8k.\n\nHe then continued harassing her, claiming she would take him back and he knew it. After being informed he would face harassment charges, he told her he would do whatever he wanted and there would be no consequences, because it's social media. Mind you, she can't block him, because she still needs to collect the several thousand she's owed.\n\nHe then messaged her late at night claiming he was going to kill himself and she doesn't know what she'll miss until it's too late. She left the message marked unread, only reading it through the notification bar, and didn't touch it with a ten-foot pole. Haven't heard from him since.\n\nHis daughter messaged my BFF and sent screenshots where dear unc had claimed my friend attacked him when he tried to leave, busted him in the back of the knee, twisted his arm behind his back and tried to break it, and wouldn't let you leave. Obviously, his daughter tried to verify events, because as scrappy as my friend is, she's over a foot shorter than him and about 70lbs lighter. He also claimed \"I'm glad to be out of it. She was a controlling, manipulative bitch and if things didn't go her way there was hell to pay.\"\n\nHe had his word, she had screenshots. Suffice to say his daughter now knows what really happened with that skirmish. She doesn't know everything, though.\n\nYesterday, he logged onto Xbox Live and started playing State of Decay II, despite staying with his brother who does not own an Xbox, so I can only assume he ran out and bought it. You would think his priority would be clothes and a bike so he can work, given he left only with the clothes on his back, but I digress.\n\nI sent him a message saying \"Where's our money, Mr. Stacks-for-an-Xbox?\" and, unsurprisingly, he unfriended me. NBD, obviously. I then messaged him on Facebook messenger that the very message being sent was his official notice that myself and my best friend would be seeing him in court for unpaid debt. Given he acknowledged his debt over Facebook messenger and everything is documented, he would be really stupid to try and deny that he owes us.\n\nHe blocked me. Oh no, whatever will I do? /s\n\nNow, I have a vague idea of where he's at (the opposite side of town from me, with his bro) but I don't have a vehicle. I have low funds, but decent internet and lots of time, as well as a smartphone. I know his XBL gamertag, email address, and phone number. I also know he has an active warrant for his arrest.\n\nWith all this context, I'm sure that your average ILPT compatriot can see that I'm justified. Now, I just need ideas on how to bring about this retribution. I need as low risk, high reward as possible, because I don't want to chance the kids getting caught up in it. \n\nI warned him when he started dating her that regardless of our relationship, I'd make him regret it if her ever hurt her. I might be a pushover, but I'm a man of my word. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 5, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "b85h24", "name": "t3_b85h24", "created_utc": 1554139746.0, "title": "ILTP Request : How to boot People Offline on xbox?", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "b86dda", "name": "t3_b86dda", "created_utc": 1554142693.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST: Teach me how to skim cc\u2019s", "selftext": "Im a college student looking to use the card info so I can write on blank cards and purchase things like gas and food.

I've always felt like it would be so easy. Those NBC news, <City> newspaper, Inmotion entertainment stores etc. They usually only have one employee working and have some of the most easy items to steal right on the outside where they can't see: of course I'm talking about those fancy neck pillows. Today I put it to the test even though I've literally never stolen anything (physical) before. I'm an unsuspecting white 22 year old who was on a layover in a large international airport in the US with some time to kill. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first target was a typical \"newstand\", won't say the name. I went to the neck pillow roller right outside the store, with a few other people browsing them as well. I picked one up, played around with it for a bit, and then just started walking away. Eventually sat down at a gate and put it in my backpack and took the tags off. Looked it up and it only costs $10. Lame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd passed by a few stands with those nice, $60 neck pillows with vented cooling technology. The most expensive ones I've seen at an airport. I really wanted one of those. This one was more of an open air kiosk, with one employee. I walked around in the kiosk, then gravitated back to the neck pillow spinner. It was literally right next to the cash register, but the employee was checking someone out and distracted. I picked it up, looked it over, and casually walked away once again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird one was most risky. My flight was already boarding and about to close its doors, but I wanted more. Went into a large news/local merch market with at least 5 employees walking around. Found the stand with the interesting electronics on it. I had to pick something fast, so I just grabbed some hipster branded bluetooth earbuds(turns out the power banks were behind a barrier that had to be taken off) I walked around the store a bit more, stuffed it in my jacket I was carrying when the time was right, and went straight to my terminal and got on my flight. $60 pricetag, obviously overpriced but they're pretty decent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got to my arrival airport(small, regional, only one news kiosk past security) I didn't see much that interesting and the employees' visibility was pretty good. just grabbed a lightning to headphone jack adapter(that they were charging $25 for lol) and got on out of there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else have experience with these or feel like they're easy targets? Their profit margins must be so high, especially on the neck pillows, that they just don't care that much.

There is some confusion on this topic about chances of getting caught, what works, etc. Here is the main character\u2019s advice:\n\nFirst: Only try with fake 20s. It\u2019s pretty common practice to run a pen over 100s to check their authenticity, but not as much with 20s. This will also take longer. \n\nAlso, there are tips for aging the bills to make them look more authentic. There are posts around that describe this. \n\nWHERE: The best bet is on characters in this book going to high school football/basketball games. Often, these venues don\u2019t even take cards, so cash is the only thing accepted. Generally, for times sake, these venues only check 100s. It won\u2019t be abnormal for a character to use a $20 to buy a $2 hot dog. That gives the character $17ish in legit cash, considering taxes. \n\nAnother good place to go is to the mall. Many clothing stores have rules against checking money in front of the customer, to prevent the customer from feeling discriminated against. The author knows, as he used to manage a place like that. \n\nFast food restaurants are also pretty good bets. The busier the venue, the less likely the bill will be to get checked, but like I said, most businesses in this book don\u2019t check anything that isn\u2019t a $100.\n\nONLY USE ONE FAKE BILL AT A TIME, that\u2019s the golden rule \n\nWhat if a character is caught? Plead ignorance. It\u2019s extremely easy to get a fake 20 by accident, whether one is selling something on Facebook, Craigslist, or potentially, one could have gotten it from that gas station down the street. \n\nThe author understands that this sub doesn\u2019t like the phrase \u201cthey won\u2019t really care\u201d, but this is truly the case. A business doesn\u2019t gain anything from calling the police, since it can\u2019t even be proven that the character in question even knew the bill was fake. \n\nThis reverts back to the golden rule. ONLY USE ONE AT A TIME.\n\nIf a character is at Best Buy trying to buy Beats with 10 20s, and they all fail the counterfeit pen test, they will probably still not call the police, but ban them from the store. \n\nRemember, only use one a time, and always plead ignorance if caught.", "score": 2270, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "baammr", "name": "t3_baammr", "created_utc": 1554595531.0, "title": "ILPT Request: Using fake paycheck stubs to finance car", "selftext": "Your boy is freshly out of prison, so job length isn\u2019t there.

While doing this move your card up and down until you press in the latch, when you press down on the latch turn the knob and the door will open. This method will only work with latches facing outward. Most interior doors in a house can be opened like this, in public buildings however the doors open outward due to fire code. This means that the previous technique will not work. You will have to cut a small part of the card away near one edge to make a gap in the card that looks like the gap before the heel of a high heeled shoe.

So how about some tips from me on how to do something illegal: shoplift.  Your reasons for shoplifting are important. I did it because I'm broke and enjoy getting high. Alright,\n\nOver the past six months I've stolen $300-500 worth of wine, liquor and regrettably benadryl (since stopped using, its an awful drug.) I think I've gotten really good at shoplifting. my tips:\n\n1. Look the part. don't look antisocial. Be clean and well dressed, preferably white, but not too well dressed. Get the dead look out of your eyes. Try to put on a smile. Walk erect and with purpose, the anxiety is gonna make you wanna speed walk straight to the goods but don't. Walk normally.\n2. Do not make eye contact or look at the workers. Normal shoppers don't unless they need something, do not fucking talk to the people because it can look weird and this is the no. 1 idiot advice on shoplifting. Do not talk to or engage the workers. You're a ghost.\n3. Walk at a normal pace to where the item is, grab it, either conceal it immediately or walk to an aisle where there's no one, and conceal it. This is the real risk moment. There's nothing you can do to stop someone randomly rounding the corner and seeing you stealing. Once its concealed without event just take the back of the aisles to the exit and stroll out. Oh yeah, wear clothing that makes it look like you're not able to conceal anything. I do this in jeans and a t shirt. Never wear a coat or sweater or anything like that. Never have a backpack or any kind of bag, it puts you on security's radar. Oh yeah, on cameras and blindspots, this brings me to my next point\n4. Do not shoplift at places you know to have security. Big chains will have security. Grocery stores in affluent neighborhoods often don't have security in my anecdotal experience, granted, no rule is 100 percent when it comes to theft. If you walk in and see dummy domes instead of real cameras, no place where a security office can be, no one doing aggressive customer service checks or a big hulking dude walking around with an empty shopping cart, you know there's probably no security. No real cameras, so no need to worry about blindspots.\n\nOther info:\n\nHaving worked retail I know how loss prevention works. Its always a big guy with a small female who makes the actual observation of the theft because she slides under thieves radars, the big guy comes in and makes the apprehension. Different stores have different rules on engaging thieves but the golden rule is that LP's will only chase you to the edge of the store's property. Very gung ho ones might do more assuming you will not call the cops. But basically, do not steal where they have LP's. You can even walk into the employee only area and pretend to be lost or something, and check around for LP's. I've done it. They just ask you what you're looking for, tell them you were looking for a certain brand of dish soap or some shit.\n\nChoose your targets well. I absolutely rape a grocery store nearby my house because its a soft target and the wine is placed well for theft. You can fit a medium sized bottle of wine horizontally down your pants atop your pubic bone, I do it all the time. Oh yeah, and be in and out of the place in under a minute if possible, two minutes at the absolute most. This is the most important rule. Be in and out in under a minute.\n\nOh yeah, and having worked at Shopko in Oregon the LP gave us this whole big spiel about how he will nail any employees who try to steal, but it just made me better at stealing. One thing I learned, certain objects are too small for LP's to even attempt to stop you. There's too great a chance for you to have ditched it and they have no way of knowing. Sterling silver rings were the no. 1 loss point of this particular store because women can just grab it and put it in their purse, and one wrong stop leads to a lawsuit running into the tens of thousands of dollars or more if the thief so much as pulls a hamstring.\n\nHaving worked at Dairy Mart I can tell you some chains will not prosecute because they don't consider it worth the money. We had thieves routinely steal and honestly I didn't even care, I watched people steal and did nothing about it. It was funny to me. I have worked at walmart, kmart, all the places basically. I have a good level of understanding of how LP's work. Of course, the real money to be made in shoplifting is organized retail crime, but that's federal territory. If you wanna get that crazy and life the fast life then do it, but you'll go to prison. Both my parents lived similar lives and both went to state prison.

Maybe for fun, maybe you want to shut them off for whatever reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you need:\n\nA computer\n\nSome software\n\nA little bit of knowledge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst you need a program called Angry IP Scanner. Download it and open it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo to Preferences>Ports and add ports 80, 8080, and 23\n\nThen go to Tools>Fetchers and add Web Detect\n\nNow, start scanning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally, you can figure out what stuff is based on hostname and web detect. If you're unsure, open the IP address in your web browser and see what it is.\n\nStuff like DNVRS-Webs is almost always a camera, but it may vary depending on where you are and what type of firmware and stuff they have installed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour best bet is if you can find something that says \"wfe\" or similar in the web detect, which will usually give you access to all the cameras with just one password. (Sometimes logging into individual cameras may not work, but this method does)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you get to a login screen, figure out what brand of camera it is, or what kind of web client they're using for their cameras. A lot of web clients have default passwords that are automatically there when the cameras are setup, and  if they're incompetent enough, they won't bother to change it. You can find a list of default passwords [here](https://ipvm.com/reports/ip-cameras-default-passwords-directory)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your password isn't on that list, search the name of the web client they're using followed by default password. For example, if I got to a login page that said exacqvision web client, I would search \"exacqvision default password\" or \"exacqvision web client default password.\" There are 2 that I've encountered actually doing this, which are Vmax web viewer and exacqvision client. Here are their logins:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVmax:\n\nusername: admin\n\npassword: (blank)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExacqvision:\n\nusername: admin\n\npassword: admin256\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they don't use the default password, you can use tools like Hydra to crack it, but that's more in depth than I'm willing to go for this post.\n\nOnce you're in, you can often shut off the cameras from the web client, and you can even move them if they have PTZ capabilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I noticed I didn't mention this, and it might seem obvious to some, but you need to actually be connected to the building's wifi network to scan for cameras (unless you're scanning a public ip range, but a lot of camera clients have a 10.0 ip which will only work in that specific network and will be different on another one)", "score": 69, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "bh3fig", "name": "t3_bh3fig", "created_utc": 1556159729.0, "title": "(ILPT) Free Spotify US Premium Upgrader Discord Bot Server", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "bh3fna", "name": "t3_bh3fna", "created_utc": 1556159750.0, "title": "ILPT Request: A kid on play station keeps DDosing me and my friends.

If you keep walking you will come to a river which would be perfect to fish in on a lazy summer day. I am 100% sure the river is public fishing grounds because there is a trail a couple of miles from our house and the same river runs through it, and there are signs posted saying it is public hunting and fishing grounds.

The trip takes around 16 hours and it will be in the middle of August, so it will be very hot.\n\nConsidered making a dummy luggage without any name or fingerprint on it that would be put down on the storage space of the bus and only taken out at the destination. At every border it takes around 2-4 hours to get past it and in that time we have to get off the bus and go present our pastports/ids (at some the border patrol just gets on the bus, checks everyones id and thats it).  In the time the bus is empty they might be checking it with dogs both at the luggage compartiment and in the bus so maybe the best option is to keep it on self?

You will need a skimmer, or sometimes referred to as a shimmer. You will need to purchase one off the dark net. Multiple YouTube videos show you how to access it. From there you easily find dealers with a bunch of these. Depending on what one you buy, which will be easy because sellers will list any kind of info. You can either get one that can send data as someone swipes their card, to your phone, or you can get one where you will have to return to the scene to retrieve your skimmer and then remove data off of it. Obviously the second option will be cheaper. But I recommend minimizing your chances at getting caught throughout the entire process. \n\n\nthe hardest part will be getting enough balls to actually walk up to a gas pump or ATM and insert it. Depending on the skimmer you have will also limit to what you can put in. Make sure it matches something you\u2019ve seen. \n\nLet\u2019s go over what a credit card skimmer actually does: a credit card skimmer is just an easy way to collect a pool of credit card numbers. The pool will keep getting fresh new data as long as the skimmer is well placed/hidden (ie. a gas station pump). The magnetic strip on your credit card contains a ton of information including but not limited to the name on the card, the credit card number, and expiration. The first 6 digits of the card even identify where the card came from (such as bank, issuer, etc.)\n\nOkay, so now we\u2019ll assume you have a skimmer and already inserted it somewhere and pulled data off of it. What now? \n\n\n1) You can sell large swaths of these CC numbers online in auctions (again, dark web) Since you know the first 6 digits, you can even bucket them into high value cards. For example, Amex cards typically have higher credit limits than a regular debit card. You might organize the Amex cards into one list and earn more on that list than they would from say, Bank of America debit cards.\n\n2) Another thing you can do is transfer the stolen card info onto a new card BUT it is actually not as common to do this onto an existing card with your name on it. Instead, you can usually buy blank hotel keys in bulk (very easy to purchase, common item for hotels/motels). You now have 500 physical cards that you can transfer the stolen credit card info onto. Now these cards are just blank white plastic cards, so going to a store and using them is pointless and too risky. Instead, they sign up to get their own credit card machine. Some are pretty cheap or even free (such as PayPal Here or Square). You can pretend to be some store using fake information and then start physically swiping the cards with the stolen data. The advantage of physically swiping them is the transaction will appear to the processing company and bank/card issuer as done \"in-person\" since the card was swiped. These are seen as lower risk transactions since most fraud is committed via just \"keyed-in transactions\" (such as online purchases, over the phone purchases, etc.). The machine that reads the cards only reads the magnetic strip, so it doesn't recognize that these are just generic hotel keys or crappy plastic cards someone bought online. So to the machine/reader, and to the credit card company and the credit card processor, it is just a normal physically swiped transaction. Remember to select credit to avoid putting in a pin. I realize many places prefer chip, but it is not required yet nor do you need one. If you wish to use it for online purchases it is best you select a house nearby that is up for sale. Nearby so that when it\u2019s marked delivered you can go get it. Don\u2019t overthink it. Once your there walk up and get it, don\u2019t look around. Don\u2019t listen for anyone, this takes seconds unless your pansy it\u2019ll turn into minutes. Get in your car and get the fuck out. No one will react quick enough to this to be able to pull out their phone and get your plates. Unless of course you\u2019re pondering around thinking about how to get it. Also, choose a house for sale that has a relatively close walk to the front door. The least amount of time you spend here is better. \n\n\nSince I\u2019ve given info that really gives advantage to a particular group, I\u2019ll also provide info to the other side, you can say what you want but truth is, I doubt whoever does this is in the same area and read the same thing and are trying to void each other. So basically Bluetooth skimmers are the most popular. As mentioned before it\u2019s the one that sends data straight to the phone. Meaning the fraudulent person doesn\u2019t have to come back. These are without the doubt the most popular, how can you avoid them? Easy. When you pull up to a gas pump or atm. Turn your Bluetooth on, the most common listings for this are (HC-06, HC-08 and FCD_1608) or (HC-05). Or anything that looks like these. I would avoid using the gas pump. That\u2019s all I have for you guys. \n\nThank you.", "score": 70, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "blb0a8", "name": "t3_blb0a8", "created_utc": 1557142488.0, "title": "ILPT REQUEST: how would one go about selling an expired passport and are they worth anything?", "selftext": "European passport", "score": 0, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "blbowd", "name": "t3_blbowd", "created_utc": 1557146590.0, "title": "ILPT Request: i'm looking for free audiobooks online in english or german.

Get a hard hat, a high viz jacket (a bit of luck) and pretend to be a worker. Story of me trying it in post.", "selftext": "I've always heard the rumour that if you wear a hard hat and a high viz jacket you can get access to any event without paying, and I always wanted to try it out. I did some research on the mighty internet and only found a couple of videos trying this, but they seemed the kind that would be staged and I wanted to try this myself. \n\nSo, one day, me and two friends tried this to see if it would work or not. We already had hard hats thanks to our school training and high viz jackets taken from our cars. We decided to start testing this theory on small things, like the zoo and various museums. It was harder than we thought, since the person at the entrance would always ask some kind of question about what we were doing, but keeping a straight face and calmly saying that we were just surveying the area for a future work that had to be done was enough to convince them lo let us in. The fact that we had a high school diploma in construction helped us quite a lot when we had to lie, but a quick search on Google can easily give you enough information to lie quite convincingly.\n\nSince it all went well, we decided to step it up a notch and tried to sneak into some concert. First we tried small concerts and everything went fine, but when we wanted to get into bigger concerts we faced a big problem. They usually have some kind of pass that they give to the workers, so we thought that our adventure ended right there. Then, a friend noticed that many people just put their pass inside a shirt pocket or under some piece of clothing, since it probably annoys them when they're working and when it's there it's not visible, but the security guards don't ask them for it. So, we got three necklace pass holder and just put them so that the pass couldn't be seen. It worked flawlessly, no one stopped us, we just got in and we did whatever we wanted. We took our high viz jacket and hard hats off, mixed with the public and enjoyed the concert without paying. \n\nNow, at this point we were confident that we could get in in any place or event. A bit too cocky, I admit, but the success rate showed that we were doing everything right. So, since all of us are petrolheads, we aimed very high. We wanted to get into the paddock during a F1 weekend. Since this was a huge event with strict security, we had to make a plan, and a quite good one. We thought of everything, but we couldn't make a good enough plan that seemed good enough to work. The F1 weekend was getting closer and closer and we didn't have any plan for it. So, we decided to wing it, we had nothing to lose. We don't live far away from the circuit, so, even if we didn't make it, we wouldn't lose any money on hotel or restaurants. We went very early during the week, on Tuesday, to the circuit. They were building all the motorhomes and setting up everything. There was little to no security, we just entered the circuit without anyone asking for anything. We were wandering around the circuit admiring how everything was being built, when we heard someone yell at us: \"Hey, you! What are you doing?\". We thought we were fucked, so we just apologized and tried to make some excuse, but before he could say anything he just yelled again: \"Get back to work! You're not paid for doing nothing! What kind of security guards are you? Get back to your position! Also, where are your passes?\". We looked at each other and understood that was our chance. We said that nobody gave us anything, the guy then angrily called another guy that had a lot of passes in his hand and just gave us three personnel passes, all while complaining that every year there is more and more disorganization. We grabbed the passes and went with the guy that explained us what to do and where to go. We just followed his instruction and, at the end of the day, we went home with three passes for a full weekend access to the paddock. \n\nThat was the last time we tried it, since we understood we were very very lucky and didn't want to push our luck too far.", "score": 79, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "blsab8", "name": "t3_blsab8", "created_utc": 1557244053.0, "title": "Request: what deceases to get a easy medical certificate", "selftext": "[removed]", "score": 1, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "blsadk", "name": "t3_blsadk", "created_utc": 1557244061.0, "title": "ILPT: Will someone please clear up the Amazon scams once and for all?", "selftext": "People have been saying the limit is 300 while others say its 500.

When a ticket inspector gets on board and downloads the list of  all the cards that tapped in will a card that doesn't have enough balance show up as declined on their machine? From what i've read the system updates every 15 minutes.\n\n2. Is there some way to make your phone generate a new card number each time for NFC? So then you can theoretically just regenerate a new number for your next bus trip.", "score": 7, "label": "illegallifeprotips"}, {"id": "bmjpv5", "name": "t3_bmjpv5", "created_utc": 1557407922.0, "title": "ILPT Request - Ways to get refunded", "selftext": "Hello there fellas,\n\nI am here to seek some expertise on how to \"scam\" a software company called imyfone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically I wanted to wipe my iphone and backup contacts, text messages and other history, which I did pretty easily.\n\n[https://www.imyfone.com/backup-and-restore-iphone/](https://www.imyfone.com/backup-and-restore-iphone/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is I had to pay 40$!!!
